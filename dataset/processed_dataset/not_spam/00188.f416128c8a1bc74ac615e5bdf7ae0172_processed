can
someon
pleas
tell
me
what
a

constitut
i

it

thi
sound
more
formal
just
an
area
of
the

by
the
prom
where

s
allow
to
make
hi
sculptur
weymouth
is
where
i

still
live
there
so
i
m
pretti
familiar
with
the

i
think
he
use
some
sort
of
armatur
for
some
bit
it
s
not
just
sand
they
usual
get
vandalis
though
after
a

it
obvious
is
a
good
idea
to
break
into
the
enclosur
and
kick
all
the
sculptur
to
bit
then
again
weymouth
is
pretti
run
down
and
