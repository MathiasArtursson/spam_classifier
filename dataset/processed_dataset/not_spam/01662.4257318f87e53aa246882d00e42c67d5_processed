i
think
one
step
toward
deploy
is
creat
a
re
usabl
token
for
mail
messag
the
current
codebas
doesn
t
expos
an
easi
to
use
or
easi
to
custom
token
token
couldn
t
be
easier
to
use
it
take
a
string
argument
and
produc
a
stream
of
token
whether
via
explicit
list
or
gener
or
tupl
or
doesn
t
matter
all
the
token
function
in
gbay
py
and
timtest
py
are
freeli
interchang
thi
way
note
that
we
have
no
evid
to
support
that
a
customiz
token
would
do
ani
good
or
if
it
would
in
which
way
custom
could
be
help
that
s
a
research
issu
on
which
no
work
ha
been
done
the
timtest
modul
seem
to
contain
an
enorm
bodi
of
practic
knowledg
about
how
to
pars
mail
messag
but
the
modul
wasn
t
design
for
re
use
that
s
partli
a
failur
of
imagin
split
out
all
knowledg
of
token
is
just
a
larg
block
cut
and
past
there
it
s
done
chang
the
from
timtoken
import
token
at
the
top
to
use
ani
other
token
now
if
you
want
to
make
it
easier
still
feel
free
to
check
in
someth
better
i
d
like
to
see
a
modul
that
can
take
a
singl
messag
or
a
collect
of
messag
and
token
each
one
the
msg
and
msgstream
class
in
timtest
py
are
a
start
at
that
but
it
s
hard
to
do
anyth
truli
use
here
when
peopl
use
all
sort
of
differ
physic
represent
for
email
msg
mbox
in
variou
format
one
file
per
folder
one
file
per
msg
skip
s
gzip
gimmick
if
you
re
a
python
coder
you
should
find
it
veri
easi
to
chang
the
gut
of
msg
and
msgstream
to
handl
your
peculiar
scheme
defin
interfac
for
these
guy
should
be
done
i
d
like
to
see
the
token
by
customiz
too
tim
had
to
exclud
some
header
from
hi
test
data
becaus
there
were
particular
bias
in
the
test
data
if
other
peopl
have
test
data
without
those
bias
they
ought
to
be
abl
to
custom
the
token
to
includ
them
or
exclud
other
thi
sound
like
a
bottomless
pit
to
me
and
there
s
no
easier
way
to
custom
than
to
edit
the
code
as
readm
txt
still
say
though
massiv
refactor
would
help
hop
to
it
