turn
out
that
you
can

have
your
boot
filesystem
ext
number
and
the
boot
vmlinux
gz
file
ha
to
be
a
gzip
vmlinux
file
not
a
vmlinuz
one
which
though
obviou
isn
t
when
you
ve
been
hit
your
head
off
a
wall
for
a
few
day
also
when
you
mkf
a
filesystem
that
s
call
boot
as
far
as
the
redhat
etc
fstab
is
concern
it
wipe
that
so
when
you
boot
a
rescu
cd
it
doesn
t
mount
dev
hda
number
as
boot
and
doesn
t
inform
you
of
thi
so
it
s
dead
easi
to
work
away
on
mnt
sysimag
boot
think
you
are
work
on
dev
hda
number
and
wonder
whi
no
matter
what
you
do
noth
chang
aaaaanyway
i
have
it
boot
the
redhat
kernel
but
the
kernel
isn
t
load
root
as
dev
hda
number
it
keep
mount
dev
hda
number
curious
when
i
go
into
the
boot
prom
an
use
set
param
i
can
tell
it
to
mount
dev
hda
number
as
root
but
then
it
use
the
prom
copi
of
the
kernel
dodgi
number
number
number
kernel
which
doesn
t
know
ext
number
so
want
to
fsck
up
my
disk
rdev
on
the
vmlinux
file
befor
gzip
doesn
t
work
i
assum
you
can
t
run
rdev
on
the
gzip
version
ani
other
idea
on
how
to
tell
a
