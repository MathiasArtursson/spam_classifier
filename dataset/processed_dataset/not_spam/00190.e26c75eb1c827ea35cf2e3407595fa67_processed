onc
someth
is
out
in

world
the
m
creator
lose
control
if
i
buy
a
chair
you
built
and
then
m
decid
to
give
it
away
to
my
neighbor
by
you
re
definit
he
m
just
stole
from
you
i
don
t
endors
the
whole
riaa
thing
but
to
be
accur
you
would
have
to
duplic
the
chair
so
that
both
you
and
your
neighbour
could
continu
to
sit
down
and
ye
i
suppos
that
would
be
more
seriou
they
can
sit
on
your
copi
but
if
you
start
churn
out
exact
dup
of
a
name
brand
artifact
peopl
with
law
degre
start
to
smell
money
for
exampl
i
could
copi
a
gibson
guitar
exactli
so
long
as
a
i
don
t
put
orvil
s
name
on
the
headstock
and
b
i
licens
the

method
if
i
instead
tri
to
sell
a
homebuilt
guitar
on
ebay
with
gibson
written
in
crayon
on
the
headstock
and
then
claim
it
is
a
true

i
expect
peopl
would
get
upset
m
whi
is
it
that
peopl
don

understand
that
give

away
m
is
a
perfectli
accept
tactic
in

s
advoc
here
it
s
not
about
give

away
it
is
about
grant
endless
and
cascad
duplic
distribut
right
even
if
i
onli
