write
apart
from
twiddl
with
the
surfac
albedo
which
might
be
not
enough
we
current
don
t
have
ion
drive
with
enough
power
or
at
least
we
can
t
develop
and
deploy
them
on
time
my
estim
is
that
in
the
worst
case
we
have
number
year
number
number
e
number
second
to
move
it
one
earth
radiu
or
about
number
km
number
e
number
m
a
t
number
number
x
if
i
rememb
right
so
a
number
x
t
number
which
is
number
number
e
number
m
number
number
e
number
s
number
or
about
number
number
e
number
m
s
number
which
is
not
a
veri
larg
acceler
roughli
equival
to
the
gravit
acceler
in
these
part
divid
by
number
assum
a
number
km
wide
that
is
number
number
decimet
wide
spheric
asteroid
of
specif
graviti
number
number
number
pi
r
number
say
it
would
have
a
volum
of
number
e
number
cubic
decimet
and
thu
a
mass
of
number
e
number
kg
the
forc
we
d
have
to
appli
to
achiev
thi
acceler
would
be
roughli
equival
to
the
weight
of
number
kg
here
on
earth
so
yeah
ion
drive
are
probabl
a
no
go
unless
i
screw
up
the
calcul
here
i
think
the
forc
they
typic
exert
is
about
four
order
of
magnitud
too
small
if
we
just
want
to
hit
today
it
with
enough
of
an
impuls
that
it
would
miss
us
number
year
later
we
d
need
to
acceler
it
by
about
number
number
cm
s
a
one
ton
number
kg
mass
would
need
to
hit
it
at
about
number
e
number
m
s
or
about
ten
time
the
speed
of
light
to
achiev
thi
so
that
s
not
possibl
if
you
could
actual
put
enough
work
into
a
one
ton
mass
as
it
approach
the
speed
of
light
it
would
mass
more
so
you
could
still
do
it
with
a
one
ton
mass
but
we
don
t
have
anyth
approach
that
speed
the
impuls
requir
is
invers
proport
to
the
remain
time
to
impact
so
if
we
were
to
hit
it
after
half
the
time
ha
elaps
we
d
need
to
acceler
it
by
around
number
number
cm
s
instead
the
gravit
forc
of
an
earth
size
mass
could
provid
suffici
deflect
if
that
mass
were
about
number
number
e
number
time
as
far
away
from
the
asteroid
as
we
are
from
earth
s
center
or
about
number
number
e
number
m
or
about
number
number
time
the
distanc
from
the
earth
to
the
sun
number
number
au
and
if
that
mass
stay
so
nearbi
for
number
year
the
effect
of
continu
acceler
benefit
greatli
from
plan
ahead
sinc
they
scale
with
t
number
not
t
and
thu
the
need
acceler
scale
with
number
t
number
after
half
the
time
ha
elaps
we
d
need
four
time
as
much
acceler
to
make
it
miss
the
earth
than
if
we
were
to
start
acceler
it
now
all
of
these
number
are
a
littl
low
becaus
the
earth
present
a
slightli
easier
target
than
it
physic
size
suggest
due
to
it
graviti
well
how
much
easier
depend
on
the
speed
of
the
projectil
in
way
i
don
t
understand
they
re
also
a
littl
high
becaus
they
assum
the
forc
is
be
appli
pure
at
right
angl
to
the
asteroid
s
current
path
which
is
a
slightli
suboptim
scenario
although
for
veloc
chang
five
order
of
magnitud
smaller
than
the
rel
veloc
the
differ
is
probabl
insignific
and
they
assum
there
are
no
other
effect
on
the
asteroid
s
path
what
about

charg
could
we

charg

and
anoth
nearbi

perhap
with

beam
to
provid
the

acceler
of

all
of

if
