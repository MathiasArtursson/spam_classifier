my
impress
is
that
a

not
fit
most

veri
well
but
each
individu

group
should
collect
their

problem
that

are
lazi
if
i
current
get
number
spam
and
number
ham
a
day
and
i

have

for

i
ll
be

to

instead
howev
if
in
addit
have
to
press
a

button
for
each
ham
it
start
to
look
much
less
like
a
win
to
me
add
the
time
to
instal
and
setup
the
whole
machineri
and
i
ll
just
keep
hit
delet
the
suggest
so
far
have
been
to
hook
someth
on
the
delet
action
that
add
a
messag
to
the
ham
corpu
i
see
two
problem
with
thi
the
ham
will
be
a
bit
skew
mail
that
i
keep
around
without
delet
will
not
be
count
secondli
if
i
by
forc
of
habit
happen
to
press
the
delet
key
instead
of
the
spam
key
i
ll
end
up
with
spam
in
the
ham
anyway
i
would
like
to
look
for
a
way
to
deal
with
spam
in
the
ham
the
obviou
thing
to
do
is
to
trigger
on
the
spam
button
and
at
that
time
look
for
messag
similar
to
the
delet
one
in
the
ham
corpu
and
simpli
remov
them
to
do
thi
we
need
a
way
to
compar
two
word
count
histogram
to
see
how
similar
they
are
ani
idea
also
i
person
would
prefer
to
not
see
the
spam
at
all
if
they
get
bounc
prefer
alreadi
in
the
smtp
fals
posit
becom
the
sender
problem
to
rewrit
to
remov
the
spam
smell
in
a
well
tune
system
then
there
spam
corpu
will
be
much
smaller
than
the
ham
corpu
so
it
would
be
possibl
to
be
slightli
over
agress
when
clear
potenti
spam
from
the
ham
corpu
thi
should
make
it
easier
to
keep
it
clean
have
a
good
way
to
remov
spam
from
the
ham
corpu
there
s
less
need
to
worri
about
it
get
there
by
mistak
and
we
might
as
well
simpli
add
all
messag
to
the
ham
corpu
that
didn
t
get
delet
by
the
spam
filter
it
might
also
be
use
to
have
a
way
to
remov
messag
from
the
spam
corpu
