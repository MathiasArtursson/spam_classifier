well
first
you
need
to
look
at
the
makefil
pl
to
see
if
it
use
the
prefix
you
re
tri
to
pass
to
it
or
not
mayb
you
ll
need
to
overrid
other
path
when
do
the
make
second
the
makeinstal
macro
automat
overrid
mani
common
valu
like
prefix
or
datadir
so
it
s
complet
redund
with
the
prefix
you
re
pass
to
it
take
a
look
at
the
makefil
you
have
at
that
point
to
see
how
the
instal
target
is
and
what
it
use
last
as
chri
suggest
you
can
take
a
look
at
