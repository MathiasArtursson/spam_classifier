the
speed
is
a
problem
for
sure
it
take
a
long
time
to
do
the
rescan
of
sequenc
i
associ
it
with
hit
the
flist
button
or
when
my
background
flist
goe

i
m
run

k

ultra

disk
and
hit
flist
use
to
take
no
more
than
a
second
the
big
differ
might
just
be
percept
becaus
the
the
old
code
just
updat
all
the
folder
count
color
all
at
onc
instead
of
make
it
look
like
there
is
number
unseen
then
count
it
way
back
up
i
doubt
i
ll
have
much
time
in
the
immedi
futur
to
hack
at
thi
but
if
i
do
can
you
suggest
area
that
might
be
the
best
to
optim
if
not
do
you
think
we
can
put
in
some
prefer
to
disabl
some
of
the
more
intens
featur
i
d
rather
disabl
all
the
sequenc
support
except
unseen
of
cours
and
have
reason
speed
i
suspect
peopl
on
slow
machin
would
find
the
current
state
unus
if
i
knew
where
the
problem
wa
i
d
fix
it
myself
find
it
is
probabl
more
work
than
the
actual
fix
thi
is
becaus
of
your
hook
msgshow
updat
unseen
which
is
call
a
fun
ctio
n
which
no
longer
exist
i
suspect
you
need

thank
i
m
not
sure
i
ll
need
it
with
the
new
sequenc
code
but
i
might
doe
your
new

commit

immedi
the

i
put
