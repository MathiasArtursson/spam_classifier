one
thing
i
think
you
might
be
do
slightli
wrong
is
your
specif
of
prefix
prefix
is
the
directori
to
be
use
as
root
for
instal
file
typic
packag
use
usr
local
as
default
so
binari
might
then
go
in
usr
local
bin
document
in
usr
local
doc
and
so
forth
normal
i
find
it
suffici
to
put
prefix
usr
local
and
do
not
further
specifi
thing
like
exec
prefix
mayb
you
have
a
special
reason
for
use
the
prefix
you
chose
in
which
case
ignor
me
that
work
fine
so
i
move
to
the
next
step
make
at
the
bottem
of
the
text
i
got
the
follow
messag
cannot
open
load

when
i
got
around
to
tri
the
url
packag
i
had
no
problem
in
say
that
thi
doesn
t
necessarili
mean
that
i
wa
do
it
right
so
below
are
the
command
i
use
configur
with
emac
prefix
url
url
exec
prefix
url

i
d
make
the
same
remark
about
prefix
here
i
would
use
the
command
configur
with
emac
prefix
usr
local
to
get
w
number
to
compil
i
think
the
with
url
flag
you
should
use
is
with
url
usr
local
share
emac
site
lisp
assum
you
compil
instal
url
with
prefix
usr
local
sinc
you
appear
to
have
instal
url
in

url
configur
w
number
with
configur
with
emac
prefix
usr
local
with
url
url
url
share
emac
site
lisp
a
command
you
would
have
found
use
would
have
been
find
name
url
var
el
print
which
would
have
told
you
where
the
url
var
el
file
wa
instal
a
program
which
is
veri
use
is
checkinstal
httpaddr
it
allow
you
to
instal

from

while
still
regist
them
in
the
packag
manag
system
of
your
distro
rpm

tgz
instead
of
make

type
checkinstal
and
a

is
put
