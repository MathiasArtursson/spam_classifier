i

fork
with
thi

httpaddr
point
ot
averag
of
about

for
everi

for
gay

which
total
to
about

a

number
a

doesn
t
equal
number
or
even
number
er
that

rather
than
cast

number
a

doe
exceed
number
in

time
the
averag

wa
number
mean
some

may
have
had

number
year
of

at
that
age
and
further
hiv
it
seem
reason
to
think
that
some
the
particip
may
have
actual
slow
their
pace
a
bit
so
while
thi
studi
s
summari

is
incomplet
you
could
easili
conclud
that
the
averag
particip
in
thi
one
studi
will
have
had
over
a
thousand
partner
over
a
number
number
year
activ

and
so
the
even
more
activ
tail
of
the

could
easili
be
in
the

rang
of

thi
say
veri
littl
almost
noth
about

behavior
gay

straight
and
the
rel
preval
of

k
individu
in

group
but
it
doe
strongli
suggest
that
gay
male
with
number
k

exist
in

number
so
peopl
should
stop
treat
