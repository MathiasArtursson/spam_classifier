write

perhap
there
could
be
a

client
that
could

addit
to
the

set
each

a

they
don

add
them
to
the

i
think
peopl
will
be
much
more
motiv
to
report
spam
than
ham
i
like
the
gener
approach
that
copi
of
random
messag
will
be
sequest
for
some
period
of

befor
they
re

with
a
simpl
spam
report
scheme
thi
could
keep
the
train
up
to
date
with
littl
effort
i
ve
sketch
out
an
approach
a
listserv
like
mailman
could
do
along
these
line
and
if
i
get
some
free
time
i

hack

i
like
the
idea
of
a
pop
proxi
which
is
classifi
messag
as
they
re
pull
from
the
server
the
easiest
way
for
such
a
beast
to
be
notifi
of
spam
might
be
to
simpli
save
the
spam
in
a
special
folder
or
file
that
the
pop
proxi
would
period
consult
