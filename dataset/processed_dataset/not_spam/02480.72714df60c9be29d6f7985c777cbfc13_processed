testbuff
as
an

pointer
to

you
have

you

i

look
at

and
it
look
like
the

did
use
strlen
sizeof
will
return
the
size
of
the

type
pass

so
if
you
declar
mystr
as
char
mystr
number
it
will
return
as
the
origin
author
want
it
will
not
work
with
a

so
if

alloc
or
pass

you
as
a

these
macro
will
not
work
