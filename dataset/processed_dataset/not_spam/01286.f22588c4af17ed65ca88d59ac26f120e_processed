who
use

assassin
thi
way
i
know
most
peopl
use
sa
to
just
tag

but
i
use
it
to
also
delet
and
bounc
spam
at
number
point
i
flag
the
messag
as
spam
and
pass
it
on
at
number
point
i
bounc
the
spam
as
if
the
user
doesn

exist
in
the
hope
of
be
remov
from

list
i
have
modifi
score
on

with
larg
number
of

and
at
number
point
i
get
no

therefor
one
of
my
