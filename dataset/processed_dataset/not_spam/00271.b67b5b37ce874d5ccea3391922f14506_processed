i
have
translat
the
articl
in
full
see
end
of
post
i
think
that
i
ve
done
a
far
better
job
than
the
googl
translat
at
least
it
s
readabl
now
ani
correct
appreci
stuff
in
s
is
my
and
other
addit
to
the
debat
my
apolog
if
i
ve
paraphras
anybodi
incorrectli
i
will
be
glad
to
retract
if
anyon
is
mif
the
articl
make
four
main
point
number
absenc
of
critic
claus
in
thi
case
the
idea
is
that
the
licenc
is
invalid
becaus
it
doesn
t
specifi
under
what
countri
s
law
the
gpl
is
govern
number
specif
in
english
onli
that
for
the
end
user
as
oppos
to
busi
the
gpl
doesn
t
appli
becaus
it
s
not
written
in
french
number
arbitari
licenc
chang
the
point
here
is
that
under
french
law
the
author
can
chang
the
term
of
the
licenc
arbitarili
thi
is
becaus
ani
grant
of
right
by
an
author
must
be
clearli
delimit
in
term
of
how
long
where
to
whom
date
and
time
in
the
absenc
of
such
limit
the
origin
author
ha
the
right
to
chang
hi
softwar
back
to
close
on
a
whim
david
neari
make
the
point
that
the
copyright
holder
automat
retain
the
right
to
chang
the
licenc
scott
repli
it
simpli
requir
authoris
from
all
copyright
holder
that
s
not
my
understand
french
law
allow
a
gpl
type
licenc
on
condit
that
the
specif
condit
of
the
grant
of
such
right
are
clear
if
they
are
not
there
is
noth
to
stop
the
origin
author
take
back
hi
work
the
lawyer
see
thi
correctli
imho
as
a
weak
in
the
gpl
number
hidden
defect
roughli
thi
claus
mean
that
the
author
s
is
are
liabl
for
ani
defect
if
the
consum
is
not
an
it
engin
so
if
linux
blow
up
and
data
is
lost
then
the
author
are
liabl
ciaran
johnson
say
that
m
dollar
oft
and
other
have
similar
claus
the
point
here
is
that
they
are
all
invalid
just
that
thi
one
affect
the
gpl
also
niall
o
broinn
make
the
point
that
it
is
not
a
sale
but
rather
a
servic
leas
arrang
and
that
s
whi
it
doesn
t
come
under
thi
point
i
would
suggest
that
the
whole
thrust
of
thi
articl
ha
been
to
see
softwar
sale
even
if
no
money
chang
hand
as
govern
veri
much
by
consum
law
in
franc
anyway
rick
moen
make
the
point
that
it
is
not
a
sale
but
rather
a
grant
of
right
which
are
not
default
see
the
bit
about
even
the
grant
of
right
by
an
author
have
to
be
explicitli
specifi
under
french
law
the
fact
that
two
ip
lawyer
in
franc
think
that
the
gpl
is
cover
as
a
sale
make
me
feel
that
there
is
a
de
facto
sale
and
a
de
facto
contract
number
roughli
there
may
be
other
reason
under
french
law
whi
the
gpl
may
be
invalid
whole
articl
freedom
a
is
worth
more
than
these
imperfect
licenc
specialis
lawyer
look
at
the
gpl
lawyer
cyril
rojinski
duli
appoint
to
the
court
and
the
jurist
vincent
grynbaum
both
specialis
in
the
area
of
intellectu
properti
examin
the
free
licenc
and
in
particular
the
gpl
they
have
publish
their
studi
in
the
review
propriet
intellectuel
intellectu
properti
number
and
their
conclus
is
grim
their
approach
is
interest
the
problem
for
them
is
not
to
know
whether
freedom
is
valid
under
french
law
for
them
the
question
is
a
moot
point
but
rather
they
ask
themselv
about
the
form
and
the
content
of
the
text
of
free
licenc
and
in
particular
the
gpl
the
problem
is
not
free
programm
but
rather
the
licenc
contract
of
free
programm
absenc
of
critic
claus
the
author
tell
us
that
first
of
all
the
refer
to
copyright
is
not
legal
suffici
in
the
framework
of
intern
contract
which
is
the
case
of
licenc
contract
for

develop
and
spread
via

the
idea
of
copyright
can
basic
includ
differ
from
one
countri
to
anoth
thi
is
whi
under

it
is

the

us
that
at

in

no

in

number
howev
it
turn
out
that
a

such
as
the
gpl
is
contrari
to
french

in

firstli
it
is

c

declar
that
as
far
as

the
toubon

is
probabl
doom
to

sinc
it
is
in

of

but
whatev
about
that
the
problem
is
still
valid
for

while

it
sinc
it
is
the

anoth
problem
much
more
seriou
is
that
accord
to
french

the
author
of
a

can
at
ani
time
invok
the
invalid
of
the
licenc
for
thi
softwar
by
simpli
chang
the
licenc
in
effect
the
law
of

stipul
that
the

is
subordin
to
the
condit
that
each
of
these
grant
right
be
the
object
of
a
distinct
claus
in
the
grant
act
i
e
the
licenc
and
that
the
grant
of
ani
such
right
be
delimit
with

scope
and
it
grante
and
also
with

where
such

may

durat
of
ani
such

thi
is
not
the
case
of

nor
of

briefli
thi
mean
that
in

or
elsewher
if
the
author
is
french
that
which
is
under

could
revert
to

from
one

next
the

an

that
of

thi
is

howev
whatev
is

one
cannot
free
