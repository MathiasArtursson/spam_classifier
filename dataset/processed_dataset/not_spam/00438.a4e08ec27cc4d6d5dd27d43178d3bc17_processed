martin
by
my
calcul
provid
more
storag
at
onli
slightli
slower
speed
at
half
the
price
is
there
ani
overrid
reason
whi
i
should
go
with
the
more
expens
and
lower
capac
dd
number
drive
other
than
speed
the
adr
advanc
digit
record
tape
format
is
an
interest
option
one
i
hadn
t
seen
much
of
befor
look
as
if
onstream
spun
off
from
philip
electron
in
number
invent
and
rather
tightli
control
the
format
though
other
compani
such
as
verbatim
do
make
compat
media
under
licenc
if
you
re
reason
seriou
about
backup
you
need
to
plan
for
a
rotat
backup
scheme
and
retir
of
tape
as
they
becom
worn
and
well
befor
they
start
fail
that
requir
at
least
a
coupl
of
dozen
tape
for
the
first
coupl
of
year
therefor
cost
and
avail
of
media
are
or
should
be
a
major
factor
also
tape
head
wear
out
and
need
to
be
replac
more
rapidli
for
helic
scan
system
which
adr
turn
out
not
to
be
and
somehow
that
alway
end
up
be
cheaper
for
tape
technolog
in
which
there
is
heavi
competit
the
less
tangibl
consider
that
come
most
immedi
to
mind
is
that
if
one
s
onstream
adr
drive
fail
the
onli
possibl
replac
that
would
suffic
to
restor
your
accumul
backup
set
is
anoth
onstream
adr
drive
in
that
sens
you
re
somewhat
lock
in
i
m
not
see
adr
drive
from
anyon
els
though
i
might
have
miss
them
if
onstream
are
smart
they
ve
price
the
drive
to
attract
peopl
into
the
system
and
are
make
up
the
shortfal
on
media
cost
after
they
get
peopl
to
buy
in
