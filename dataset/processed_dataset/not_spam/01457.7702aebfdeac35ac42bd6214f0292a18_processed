thi
is
not
directli
spamassassin
relat
but
more
of
a
gener
deal
with
spam
issu
what
is
the
best
way
to
deal
with
spam
dure
the
smtp
transact
there
are
domain
and
address
that
i
know
are
spam
at
the
mail
from
and
can
deal
with
at
the
smtp
level
i
have
been
and
i
think
most
peopl
respond
with
a
number
number
number
code
a
perman
error
that
pretti
much
mean
don
t
bother
to
tri
from
that
address
again
you
ll
get
the
same
error
peopl
often
add
cathart
messag
to
accompani
the
number
like
spammer
must
die
but
thi
might
not
be
the
best
way
to
go
you
are
tell
the
spammer
that
you
are
on
to
them
thi
may
caus
them
to
tri
other
method
to
get
around
your
block
is
it
perhap
better
to
blackhol
the
mail
that
is
act
like
everyth
is
ok
dure
the
smtp
transact
but
then
just
drop
the
mail
into
the
bitbucket
thi
is
gener
how
spamassassin
work
sinc
almost
everyon
use
it
after
the
smtp
transact
ha
complet
success
spammer
think
everyth
is
go
fine
and
ha
no
reason
to
tri
new
method
then
there
is
a
third
possibl
instead
of
return
a
number
code
indic
you
re
on
to
the
spammer
fake
a
number
number
number
respons
which
is
say
mailbox
doe
not
exist
thi
would
be
in
the
hope
that
some
spammer
out
there
actual
remov
name
report
as
non
exist
from
their
list
i
know
a
slim
hope
but
even
if
onli
a
few
do
it
can
lower
the
incid
so
what
are
the
argument
for
each
do
spammer
even
look
at
ani
of
the
bounc
messag
they
get
the
volum
of
bounc
must
be
huge
person
i
m
start
to
think
blackhol
are
the
way
to
go
but
send
back
that
spammer
die
die
die
or
stock
access
dee
