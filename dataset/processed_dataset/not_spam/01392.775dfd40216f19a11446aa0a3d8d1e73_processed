well
my
point
is
more
that
we
should
aim
our
rescor
algorithm
so
that
a
spam
hit
number
number
ani
higher
doe
us
no
good
as
it
mean
an
fp
is
a
lot
harder
to
recov
from
use
compens
rule
agre
but
i
have
alway
thought
that
the
valu
number
wa
not
the
best
valu
it
should
have
been
number
i
understand
that
initi
onli
spammi
score
were
includ
but
i
believ
the
algorithm
should
be
pure
symmetr
and
non
spammi
neg
valu
should
also
have
been
balanc
out
the
spammi
posit
valu
like
they
do
in
sa
today
then
anyth
that
wa
posit
would
be
spam
and
anyth
neg
would
be
non
spam
and
i
guess
exactli
zero
is
grey
today
s
choic
of
number
just
add
an
offset
which
i
think
caus
peopl
to
assum
thing
work
differ
than
they
do
