error
ah
i
think
i
just
found
the
caus
nmh
is
broken
which
is
probabl
obviou
from
my
previou
mail
the
man
page
for
pick
and
how
it
alway
use
to
work
wa
that
list
would
list
messag
match
nolist
would
supress
that
if
sequenc
is
given
the
default
is
nolist
without
sequenc
the
default
is
list
that
s
all
fine
but
it
appear
now
which
probabl
mean
i
had
never
use
pick
sinc
i
upgrad
nmh
last
that
what
count
is
the
order
of
list
and
sequenc
that
is
if
sequenc
come
after
list
the
list
get
turn
off
sequenc
impli
nolist
instead
of
just
make
nolist
the
default
an
easi
workaround
for
thi
is
to
make
sure
that
list
is
the
last
arg
given
