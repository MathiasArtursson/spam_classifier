preati
heavi
implic
unless

s
just
bs
anybodi
buy
a
box
like
thi
is
undoubtledli
go
to
integr
it
into
their
crypto
infrastructur
what
s
the
point
of
put
in
a
box
like
thi
if
it
s
not
an
activ
particip
in
your
secur
framework
or
you
could
just
not
bloat
it
number
x
to
begin
with
nah
that
wa
the
whole
point
of
xml
afteral
to
sell

like
oracl
s
use
of

licens
due
to
the
perform
hit
blah

execut
core
convert
xml
to
machin
code
said
kelli
mmmmmmmmmmm
machin
code
never
a
good
idea
uhhh
fundament
it
s
all
machin
code
kelli
s
comment
seem
more
like
drivel
from
a
clueless
marketroid
than
anyth
of
technic
concern
have
what
appear
to
be
a
silicon
xml
router
would
be
a
cool
thing
have
one
integr
with
your
crypto
environ
would
kick
ass
let
it
deseri
decrypt
repackag
the
xml
befor
hand
it
off
to
the
app
server
the
question
of
