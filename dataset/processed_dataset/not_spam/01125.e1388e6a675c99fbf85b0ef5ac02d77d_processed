said
it
did
for
me
but
i
am
not
will
to
say
it
is
not
a
tcl
tk
issu
as
other
app
seem
to
work
ok
for
cut
and
past
and
tk
doe
it
clipboard
stuff
a
bit
differ
than
most
toolkit
so
i
m
not
about
to
place
blame
just
report
my
experi
one
more
salvo
on
x
and
cut
past
x
specifi
at
least
two
mechan
for
cut
past
but
as
usual
mandat
no
polici
window
and
macintosh
have
a
slightli
differ
mechan
and
one
uniform
polici
i
m
quit
sure
that
tk
implement
all
primari
and
clipboard
select
accur
the
primari
select
is
the
one
that
is
tie
to
the
visibl
select
on
your
x
display
the
clipboard
select
is
the
one
with
the
explicit
copi
step
and
is
the
same
as
what
you
have
on
window
and
macintosh
howev
exmh
throw
in
support
for
the
cutbuff
mechan
which
is
anoth
archaic
mechan
support
at
one
point
perhap
still
today
by
version
of

exmh
ha
a
polici
that
tri
to
unifi
all
these
mechan
under
one
umbrella
and
by
all
report
it
is
not
that
great
i
would
encourag
folk
to
play
with
those
number
line
