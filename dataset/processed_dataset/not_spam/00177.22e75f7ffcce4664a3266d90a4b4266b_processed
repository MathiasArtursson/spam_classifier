second
one
could
make
the
assumpt
that
ancient

futur

would
not
be
hydrocarbon
base
there
are
altern
fuel
sourc
includ
seab
methan
biomass
and
all
the
usual
suspect
solar
hydro
etc
some
of
these
could
be
exploit
on
a
decidedli
low
tech
ie
emerg
civil
basi
howev
it
is
difficult
to
conceiv
of
an
industri
civil
that
doesn
t
employ
wheel
axl
and
bear
all
of
which
requir
lubric
i
m
not
an

robin
anyon
but
it
s
my
understand
that
veget
lubric
break
down
under
stress
and
that
oil
or
graphit
lubric
are
the
onli
reason
choic
for
high
temperatur
high
rotat
applic
at
least
prior
to

advanc

of

synthesi
thi
is
a
good
point
there
are
a
lot
of
altern
to
hydrocarbon
product
deriv
from
petroleum
but
these
have
often
been
develop
as
a
replac
for
petroleum
after
the
technolog
ha
been
establish
there
is
a
grow
industri
in
plant
deriv
plastic

lubric
but
thi
is
to
replic
materi
that
have
been
previous
creat
much
more
easili
within
the
petrochem
industri
veget

lubric
have
been
use
the
russian
use
sunflow
oil
in
the
lubric
system
of
tank

dure
the
second

and
work
is
be

to

diesel

from

restaur
jay
s
correct
in
hi
opinion
that
veget
oil
is
not
as
durabl
as
petroleum
oil
but
thi
is
onli
becaus
of
the
lack
of
sophist
of
the
chemistri
involv
synthet
fuel
and
lubric
are
continu
be
develop
and
i
don
t
see
ani
problem
with

ultim
match
the
perform
of
the
more
convent
product
as
the
rock
oil
run
out
plant
oil
deriv
will
be
develop
to
fill
the
gap
in
parallel
chang
will
occur
in
the
design
of
the
machin
to
cope
with
ani
chang
in
perform
of
the
lubric
my
big
concern
is
if
the
technolog
were
ever
to
be
lost
for
some
reason
re
creat
a
petrochem
industri
from
scratch
without
petrochem
that
is
go
immedi
to
plant
base
synthet
would
be
extrem
difficult
especi
if
it
were
necessari
to
recreat
all
of
the
petrochem
deriv
product
not
just
lubric
and
fuel
i
suspect
that
bear
in
mind
the
ingenu
of
the
human
race
it
would
happen
just
at
a
differ
pace
imagin
an

revollut
base
on
for
exampl
methan
from
pig
manur

oil

all
we
