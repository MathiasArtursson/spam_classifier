around
at
my
famili
s
insist
i
tri
go
on
tv
a
few
week
ago
to
talk
about
the
corpor
crook
roam
our
great

empti
and
more
alon
i

agre
to
go
on
crossfir
and
donahu
thank

for
thi
guy
on

condit
that
i
would
not
have
to
have
one
of
those
stupid
cabl
news
shout
match
with
three
rightwingnut
where
no
one
can
hear
or
want
to
hear
what
s
be
said
they
agre
to
the
term
but
as
bob
novak
ask
hi
first
question
about
aren
t
my
true
motiv
to
destroy
capit
and
make
america
a
socialist
countri
i
just
sat
there
for
a
moment
and
didn
t
respond
i
thought
i
would
just
take
the
microphon
off
and
leav
who
need
these
f
s
but
then
my
dad
wa
with
me
in
the
studio
and
i
look
over
at
him
and
smile
and
then
into
the
camera
i
said
ye
bob
that
is
exactli
what
i
intend
to
do
and
consid
more
peopl
have
bought
my
book
than
ani
other
nonfict
book
in
america
thi
year
i
guess
that
mean
that
the
major
of
american
agre
with
me
on
thi
point
so
look
out
bob
caus
we
re
go
to
seiz
your
money
first
i
ask
the
studio
audienc
in
dc
for
a
show
of
hand
of
all
those
who
agre
and
i
wa
later
told
that
numer
hand
shot
up
in
the
air
much
to
the
chagrin
of
a
stun
bob
novak
i
also
ad
that
i
thought
the
pope
wa
onto
someth
when
he
said
that
capit
is
a
sin
my
dad
like
that
he
is
a
sweet
strong
smart
man
and
i
love
the
drive
with
him
back
home
we
took
a
spin
through
the
michigan
state
campu
and
he
told
me
how
he
had
come
down
here
after
world
war
ii
to
inquir
about
go
to
colleg
but
thought
it
best
to
return
to
the
assembl
line
where
he
had
a
secur
job
hi
year
dure
the
war
serv
in
the
marin
were
go
to
be
count
toward
hi
senior
and
so
he
work
the
spark
plug
and
oil
filter
assembl
line
for
number
year
and
provid
for
mom
and
us
kid
and
gave
us
all
hi
love
which
of
cours
matter
the
most
dad
took
me
to
the
airport
thi
morn
remark
on
the
way
how
much
mom
would
have
enjoy
thi
simpl
trip
across
town
to
bishop
airport
how
happi
she
would
have
been
know
that
i
wa
head
off
on
a
new
journey
in
my
veri
fortun
life
i
thought
about
how
she
came
to
new
york
for
the
screen
of
roger
me
at
the
new
york
film
festiv
in
number
and
how
i
got
to
introduc
her
and
my
aunt
as
they
sat
in
the
front
of
the
balconi
and
how
mom
and
aunt
loi
stood
and
took
a
long
lincoln
center
bow
and
how
i
stood
on
that
stage
and
felt
that
she
deserv
everi
bit
of
that
applaus
and
more
it
s
a
bittersweet
memori
now
as
i
ve
just
found
out
that
the
nyff
select
committe
thi
year
is
too
afraid
to
show
my
new
film
polit
is
what
i
have
been
told
too
populist
for
the
new
elit
who
now
sit
in
judgment
of
what
is
art
they
don
t
want
to
help
further
your
platform
mike
a
person
close
to
the
committe
tell
me
one
of
them
even
said
i
know
thi
film
is
go
to
be
popular
and
i
don
t
person
want
to
contribut
to
it
popular
so
it
wa
decid
that
bowl
for
columbin
a
cann
prize
winner
knight
by
the
chicago
tribun
as
one
of
the
most
effect
polit
polem
film
ever
a
film
chosen
by
everi
singl
film
festiv
around
the
world
thi
fall
no
thi
film
must
not
be
shown
at
lincoln
center
just
six
block
from
the
edit
room
where
we
made
it
number
block
north
of
ground
zero
i
ve
gone
too
far

time
cut
too
close
to
the
bone
stuck
my
len
where
it
doesn
t
belong
right
straight
through
the
heart
of
an
america
that
is
both
master
and
victim
of
the
ultra
violenc
it

so
sad
to
see
thi
place
where
i
