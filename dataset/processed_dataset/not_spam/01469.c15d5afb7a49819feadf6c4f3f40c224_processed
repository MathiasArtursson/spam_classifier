so
it
seem
to
me
that
they
do
clean
up
their
list
but
onli
when
a
spam
fail
to
deliv
or
can
t
they
detect
that
number
what
do
spammer
do
with
email
address
in
their
databas
that
are
undeliver
for
a
few
year
do
they
still
continu
to
spam
them
well
here
s
my
semi
coher
rant
for
the
moment
i
have
number
spamtrap
on
my
machin
you
can
multipli
that
by
each
domain
if
you
realli
want
to
the
vast
major
all
but
say
number
have
never
ever
exist
yet
spammer
would
semi
continu
connect
tri
to
deliv
mail
to
number
of
them
disconnect
connect
again
tri
deliv
to
number
more
over
and
over
they
kept
get
user
unknown
until
i
got
around
to
make
them
spamtrap
so
my
evid
would
suggest
that
it
depend
who
you
re
deal
with
if
your
busi
is
to
sell
address
list
to
peopl
who
would
then
spam
it
s
in
your
best
interest
to
never
clean
your
list
therefor
you
can
say
number
million
email
address
and
not
technic
be
lie
even
if
the
major
of
them
don
t
work
if
you
re
a
spammer
you
d
want
to
know
who
doesn
t
actual
exist
but
then
again
you
don
t
realli
care
you
probabl
want
to
relay
through
someon
so
it
s
harder
to
trace
you
if
you
could
you
d
send
to
everi
email
address
avail
you
don
t
want
to
setup
a
valid
bounc
address
becaus
again
it
s
easi
to
trace
you
so
i
would
say
thi
if
you
technic
spam
peopl
but
actual
think
you
re
run
a
legit
servic
you
probabl
realli
do
have
a
way
of
opt
out
even
though
the
user
didn
t
opt
in
and
you
probabl
don
t
relay
and
you
probabl
pay
attent
to
bounc
everyon
els
doesn
t
realli
care
that
s
my
view
anyway
number
randomli
gener
taglin
now
you
can
do

thing
with
your
