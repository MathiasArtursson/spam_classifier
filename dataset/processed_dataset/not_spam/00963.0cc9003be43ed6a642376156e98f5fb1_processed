s
thi
wonder
piec

els
real
hack
break
which
is
go
to
run
slow
if
a
sequenc
happen
to
start
with
a
bunch
of
messag
that
don
t
exist
i
m
not
sure
whi
it
is
import
that
the
first
messag
in
the
sequenc
return
exist
but
not
necessarili
ani
of
the
other
but
i
m
sure
glad
it
is
as
mhseqexpand
get
call
lot
and
i
don
t
know
if
i
could
cope
if
it
were
check
everi
file
in
the
sequenc
it
is
look
at
all
the
time
although
my
fingerprint
are
all
over
that
it
s
not
actual
my
code
and
ha
been
in
there
sinc
befor
number
it
s
code
that
i
move
from
mh
tcl
to
sequenc
tcl
and
back
again
i
m
no
number
sure
either
but
it
should
be
a
one
time
penalti
becaus
the
sequenc
will
be
re
written
with
the
bad
messag
remov
i
think
it
may
help
to
keep
a
list
of
the
valid
messag
number
for
the
current
folder
though
that
would
then
need
to
be
verifi
against
chang
to
the
directori
doe
tcl
have
a
directori
read
function
i
assum
so
mh
sequenc
also
goe
and
reread
the
file
mh
sequenc
and
the
context
file
but
i
m
not
sure
how
frequent
that
one
is
call
that
wa
a
problem
but
if
you
look
at
mh
sequenc
and
mh
sequenc
and
mh
sequenceupd
they
all
call
mhreadseq
to
do
the
actual
read
and
it
onli
read
the
sequenc
if
the
file
ha
been
touch
look
for
the
exmh
debug
read
dollar
filenam
output
in
the
debug
log
to
see
when
sequenc
are
actual
reread
from
disk
my
theori
is
that
ftoc

is
be
