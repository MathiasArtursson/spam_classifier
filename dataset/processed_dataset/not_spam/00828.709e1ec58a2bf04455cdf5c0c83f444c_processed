pm
you
wrote
mf
i
don
t
think
free
speech
is
a
licens
to
speak
directli
at
and
be
in
the
mf
physic
presenc
of
ani
particular
individu
of
your
choos
especi
mf
when
that
individu
is
busi
do
someth
els
and
isn
t
interest
bs
yep
i
agre
number
sure
and
that
goe
back
to
my
second
argument
cohen
they
can
walk
away
nobodi
compel
them
to
stand
there
i
ll
agre
fulli
but
we
still
have
a
constitut
right
to
speak
out
against
polici
action
and
grievanc
again
if
you
want
it
anoth
way
let
chang
the
constitut
bs
huh
are
you
say
that
whoever
ha
the
loudest
voic
get
to
be
heard
bs
shout
down
a
public
speaker
could
be
consid
a
form
of
censorship
if
bs
shout
down
public
speaker
is
protect
it
is
onli
a
matter
of
time
bs
befor
the
peopl
do
the
shout
have
their
tactic
use
against
bs
them
everi
singl
time
they
open
their
mouth
the
tactic
is
stupid
and
bs
non
product
and
if
gener
use
will
onli
result
in
chao
the
tactic
bs
is
just
stupid
ego
bation
at
best
unless
the
goal
is
to
gener
chao
bs
and
human
whose
goal
and
action
in
life
are
to
creat
chao
in
societi
bs
should
be
lock
up
provid
you
can
accur
identifi
them
which
is
not
bs
realli
possibl
anyway
but
hey
thi
is
my
rant
imho
bs
bill
no
offens
or
anyth
but
there
s
a
differ
between
hold
a
sign
that
doesn
t
agre
with
bush
and
scream
at
him
my
sole
point
as
far
as
the
number
st
amend
goe
is
that
there
is
more
to
thi
game
than
just
be
an
angri
liber
youth
which
is
the
gross
culmin
of
everyon
s
argument
sofar
the
scream
isn
t
the
most
effect
method
around
i
don
t
believ
i
argu
that
it
wa
but
scream
is
happen
becaus
the
mean
to
commun
to
the
repres
involv
are
diminish
at
least
as
far
as
the
peopl
do
the
scream
are
concern
for
the
record
i
don
t
support
the
screamer
in
organ
confer
such
as
the
colin
powel
shout
down
that
wa
mention
earlier
i
don
t
think
that
thi
is
what
the
number
st
amend
wa
impli
these
folk
do
have
a
right
to
be
heard
and
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
be
heard
by
the
folk
they
elect
in
the
first
place
my
point
my
onli
point
wa
realli
more
concern
with
the
case
such
as
mr
nell
he
wasn
t
engag
at
least
from
the
limit
fact
we
have
in
a
shoutout
but
rather
in
a
differ
of
opinion
he
ha
a
right
to
possess
thi
opinion
and
make
it
known
to
the
repres
that
are
elect
a
sign
is
not
a
shout
out
i
think
i
may
have
miss
or
not
accur
address
the
origin
thread
switch
that
took
thi
exampl
and
mix
in
the
scream
dissent
to
the
mix
i
wa
mostli
respond
with
my
miffed
in
have
broad
brush
stroke
appli
to
a
group
without
examin
the
polici
reason
that
might
have
contribut
to
it
in
thi
case
the
scream
parti
are
fed
up
with
get
corral
mile
away
from
the
folk
they
need
to
speak
with
they
re
resort
to
creativ
offens
and
constitut
challeng
mean
but
it
not
simpli
due
to
the
fact
that
they
re
number
and
have
lost
all
decorum
the
my
gener
never
did
thi
is
all
bs
there
s
more
to
thi
stori
we
just
dont
know
it
all
i
hope
thi
clarifi
my
posit
for
the
quick
rehash
scream
free
speech
on
all
case
dissent
free
speech
provid
you
follow
what
ha
been
laid
down
by
the
suprem
k
