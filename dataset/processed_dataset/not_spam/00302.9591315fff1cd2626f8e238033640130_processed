strlen
is
a
rel
expens
oper
if
you
are
use
c
thi
is
not
such
a
big
issu
as
string
length
can
be
declar
const
so
long
as
you
do
not
modifi
the
string
object
the
compil
can
do
the
cach
for
you
i
do
not
think
thi
is
possibl
in
c
though
you
could
write
the
same
code
fragment
as
for
a
number
l
strlen
somestr
a
l
a
some
thing
goe
here
if
b
l
number
do
someth
note
my
previou
point
if
some
thing
goe
here
or
do
someth
are
veri
long
function
then
there
is
no
real
need
to
optimis
thi
code
also
for
string
manipul
a
much
better
approach
would
be
char
c
char
p
for
p
somestr
c
p
number
p
some
thing
goe
here
if
p
number
number
do
someth
thi
work
becaus
c
use
number
termin
string
it
improv
perform
becaus
you
alway
have
a
pointer
to
the
charact
instead
of
have
to
do
array
manipul
strictli
speak
the
variabl
c
is
not
requir
as
most
compil
are
smart
enough
to
store
p
in
a
regist
the
problem
is
that
thi
use
pointer
arithmet
which
can
make
the
code
illeg
if
not
manag
care
which
is
one
of
the
reason
i
prefer
java
for
most
