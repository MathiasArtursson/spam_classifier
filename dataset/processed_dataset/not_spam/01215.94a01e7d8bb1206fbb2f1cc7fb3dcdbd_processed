i
realli
don
t
recommend
tri
to
upgrad
between
beta
or
from
a
beta
to
a
final
releas
either
simpli
backup
your
home
etc
and
root
and
or
usr
local
if
need
then
reinstal
cleanli
it
ll
probabl
save
a
few
hassl
and
you
ll
get
the
cleanest
possibl
system
i
think
thi
is
probabl
the
best
way
becaus
i
think
mayb
with
upgrad
you
do
not
alway
automat
get
the
latest
featur
enabl
in
some
config
file
becaus
rh
would
rather
take
it
easi
and
not
updat
that
config
file
you
get
a
rpmnew
instead
of
rpmsave
file
so
they
get
less
call
to
support
that
way
if
you
dislik
red
hat
whi
use
it
thi
wa
a
realli
bad
argument
against
use
red
hat
that
make
no
sens
at
all
i
for
one
am
glad
that
they
a
don
t
overwrit
your
config
file
on
a
whim
be
glad
they
don
t
do
some
sort
of
autodetect
and
chang
crap
b
tell
you
on
rpm
upgrad
what
config
file
you
should
look
at
becaus
format
have
chang
red
hat
is
not
take
it
easi
on
thi
it
s
put

you
don

if
you

on
a
separ
partit
no
just
instal
rh
number
and
tell
it
to
use
the
same
partit
as
home
and
tell
it
to
not
format
it
but
keep
the
data
as
is
if
you
didn
t
put
home
on
a
separ
partit
then
you
realli
do
need
to
make
backup
use
an
nf
or
smb
mount
from
anoth
machin
to
backup
and
rsync
straight
to
the
mount
or
if
that
s
not
possibl

s
the
best
way
to
make
backup
