the

let

all

okay
let
s
assum
for

that
the

aren

but
that
the

sequenc

are
re

dicey
all
you
ve
accomplish
is
move
the
queue
delay
from
the
traffic
shaper
to
the

you
still
get
l
number
to

big
deal
if
it
happen
on

in

also

rather
than
have
the

itself
do
it
the

know
exactli
when
there
is

avail
but
thi
doesn
t
even
begin
to
touch
on
other
protocol
like
udp

icmp
or
for
that
matter
ipsec
gre
whatev
tunnel
traffic
neither
of
them
have
sequenc
number

that
you
can
manipul
so
i

the

sorri
what
i

happen
is
that
the
delay
is
number
msec
as
long
as
traffic
limit
aren
t
exceed
thi
is
reason
but
when
traffic
exce
the
limit
thing
will
begin
to
be
queu
now
with
a
well
behav
tcp
stack
thi
will
mean
that
it
will
fall
back
to
lower
transmiss
rate
thi
is
how
tcp
wa
design
so
that
part
isn

all
wrong
and
again
thi
kind
of
shape
isn
t
rocket
scienc
that
is
not

that
there

a

and
what
not

there
isnt

i
would
advic
you
to

in

becaus
without

you
cant
punish

and
if

you
dont

rock
solid

to
smack
around

without

you
are
just
implement
solut
to
prevent

do
thing
that
im
my
opinion
they
arent
allow
to
do
on
their

anyway
i
dont
like
the
idea
that
employe
play

use
kazaa
icq
msn
etc
etc
in
stead
of
work
what
we
pay
them
to
do
thi
is
whi
a
secur
polici
is
import
becaus
then
you
can
say
to
employe
that
they
violat
it
and
that
there
are
consequ
for
that
deni
internet
access
etc

owke
now

better
solut
for

also

depend

you

which
wa

my
favorit
proxi
is
squid
and
there
are
probabl
a
lot
of
http
blacklist
program
that
work
with
squid
to
block

and
stuff
i
still
think
you
should
first
deni
direct
internet
traffic
from
workstat
and
onli
allow
traffic
to
the
internet
from
server
that
are
allow
to
do
so
you
should
think
about
proxi
email
server
etc
etc
thi
should
also
prevent
peopl
from
play

especi
those
quak

becaus
those
