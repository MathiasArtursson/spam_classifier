in
my
experi
there
are
spam
messag
that
sneak
past
spam
assassin
that
razor
will
pick
up
those
are
the
one
that
i
m
call
margin
basic
i
m
hope
that
the
collect
of
razor
user
make
a
better
judg
of
spam
than
ani
singl
program
like
sa
can
and
therefor
i
can
benefit
from
their
judgement
and
get
more
extens
spam
filter
i
ve
seen
exampl
of
thi
alreadi
where
sa
doesn
t
score
the
spam
high
enough
to
bounc
it
but
razor
doe
i
think
perhap
you
miss
the
fact
that
sa
score
are
adjust
if
you
want
sa
to
tag
all
messag
list
in
razor
then
you
can
put
thi
in
your
spamassassin
user
pref
file
score
razor
check
number
the
default
score
is
number
and
the
default
threshold
need
is
number
therefor
if
you
wish
to
have
ani
razor
list
messag
tag
by
sa
then
set
a
score
for
ani
razor
list
messag
to
anyth
abov
number
would
be
suffici
if
you
are
alreadi
use
sa
then
the
abov
would
be
more
effici
otherwis
you
are
run
all
of
the
mail
through
razor
twice
onc
for
sa
and
onc
again
afterward
if
you
realli
want
to
run
razor
individu
then
you
should
set
the
score
razor
check
number
so
that
sa
won
t
do
it
and
avoid
the
doubl
network
hit
howev
one
of
the
benefit
of
use
sa
in
combin
with
razor
ha
been
the
histori
of
fals
posit
report
in
the
razor
databas
the
current
score
of
number
is
hefti
but
not
enough
by
itself
to
tag
as
spam
but
for
ani
real
spam
is
usual
enough
to
push
it
over
the
threshold
razor
number
address
the
fals
posit
problem
but
is
not
yet
in
as
wide
of
use
as
razor
