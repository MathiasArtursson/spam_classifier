from
niall
o
broin
i
have
about
number
g
of
data
which
i
need
to
copi
from
one
disk
to
anoth
howev
i
m
not
sure
how
i
should
best
copi
it
the
problem
is
the
bulk
of
the
data
is
imag
and
most
of
these
imag
have
two
directori
entri
i
e
there
is
a
hard
link
to
each
file
if
i
copi
them
use
cp
a
or
my
usual
favourit
of
find
cpio
pmd
other
dir
it
s
go
to
copi
each
file
twice
which
is
not
what
i
want
dump
restor
would
take
care
of
thi
if
the
sourc
filesystem
wasn
t
reiserf
ani
suggest
do
your
and
my
favourit
it
ll
be

cpio
number
preserv
hard
link
i
e
if
f
number
and
f
number
are
hard
link
and
both
are
copi
then
the
copi
are
also
hard
link
thi
is
true
of
all
cpio
s
and
tar
and
ani
other
decent
usabl
archiv
tool
by
definit
imho
number
cpio
p
at
least
gnu
cpio
version
number
number
number
will
onli
read
write
copi
the
actual
data
byte
onc
i
think
thi
is
true
for
all
cpio
s
not
just
that
gnu
version
but
am
not
certain
if
you
use
an
intermedi
archiv
e
g
cpio
o
file
cpio
i
file
then
the
actual
data
byte
are
copi
into
the
archiv
file
under
each
name
e
g
as
both
f
number
and
f
number
but
gnu
cpio
is
smart
about
thi
in
pass
through
mode
p
copi
the
data
just
onc
or
so
i
read

thi
is
a
one

oper
that
you
won

time
isn

a
major
issu
and
are
not
use

so
storag
isn

an
issu
then
even
if
cpio
did
read
the
data
twice
so
what
as
