i
think
one
step
toward
deploy
is
creat
a
re
usabl
token
for
mail
messag
the
current
codebas
doesn
t
expos
an
easi
to
use
or
easi
to
custom
token
the
timtest
modul
seem
to
contain
an
enorm
bodi
of
practic
knowledg
about
how
to
pars
mail
messag
but
the
modul
wasn
t
design
for
re
use
i
d
like
to
see
a
modul
that
can
take
a
singl
messag
or
a
collect
of
messag
and
token
each
one
i
d
like
to
see
the
token
by
customiz
too
tim
had
to
exclud
some
header
from
hi
test
data
becaus
there
were
particular
bias
in
the
test
data
if
other
peopl
have
test
data
without
those
bias
they
ought
to
be
abl
to
custom
the
token
to
includ
them
or
exclud
other
