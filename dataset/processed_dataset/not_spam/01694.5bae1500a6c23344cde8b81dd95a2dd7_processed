so
then
tim
peter
is
all
like
i
m
not
sure
what
you
re
do
but
suspect
you
re
store
individu
wordinfo
pickl
if
so
most
of
the
administr
pickl
bloat
is
due
to
that
and
doesn
t
happen
if
you
pickl
an
entir
classifi
instanc
directli
yeah
that
s
exactli
what
i
wa
do
i
didn
t
realiz
i
wa
incur
administr
pickl
bloat
thi
way
i
m
specif
tri
to
make
thing
faster
and
smaller
so
i
m
store
individu
wordinfo
pickl
into
an
anydbm
dict
key
by
token
the
result
is
that
it
s
almost
number
time
faster
to
score
messag
one
per
run
our
of
procmail
number
s
vs
number
number
s
howev
it
doe
say
all
over
the
place
that
the
goal
of
thi
project
isn
t
to
make
the
fastest
or
the
smallest
implement
so
i
guess
i
ll
hold
off
do
ani
further
perform
tune
until
the
goal
start
to
point
more
in
that
direct
number
second
is
probabl
fast
enough
for
peopl
to
use
it
in
their
procmailrc
which
is
what
i
wa
after
if
you
re
despar
to
save
memori
write
a
subclass
that
s
probabl
what
i
ll
do
if
i
get
too
antsi
tri
to
think
of
way
to
sneak
administr
pickl
boat
into
casual
