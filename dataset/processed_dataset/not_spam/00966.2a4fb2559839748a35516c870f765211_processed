robert

said
mh
sequenc
also
goe
and
reread
the
file
mh
sequenc
and
the
context
file
but
i
m
not
sure
how
frequent
that
one
is
call
in
some
place
i
maintain
cach
of
file
by
check
their
modifi
time
but
the
sequenc
file
are
soo
small
that
by
the
time
you
stat
them
to
check
their
date
stamp
you
could
just
read
them
again
do
you
realli
think
thi
is
true
i
ad
a
modifi
time
check
think
that
it
would
make
an
improv
sinc
we
were
read
it
a
lot
more
time
in
the
new
code
becaus
we
re
tri
to
use
the
sequenc
on
the
other
hand
the
sequenc
file
are
probabl
be
read
out
of
cach
when
that
happen
anyway
even
with
a
small
file
i
d
think
that
the
time
taken
to
do
a
file
mtime
dollar
filenam
would
be
worth
it
