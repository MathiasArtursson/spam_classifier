we

talk
about
the
differ

in
previou
penguin

issu
fundament
the
two
that
you
ll
deal
with
the
most
are
block

charact

these
draw
their

from

serial

are
a
great
exampl
of
charact
devic
they
handl
data
input
and
output
on
the
fli
rather
than
fill
a
buffer
then
commit
the
data
the
physic
natur
of
these
devic
type
goe
a
long
way
toward
explain
whi
they
handl
data
as
they
do
a
hard

ha
to
physic
spin
up
to
store
or
retriev
data
you
re
actual
chang
the
magnet
properti
of
the
disc
surfac
when
you
store
data
consequ
a
hard
drive
ha
to
know
where
there
s
free
space
on
the
disc
surfac
ha
to
move
that
area
of
the
disc
under
the
write
head
and
tri
as
best
it
can
to
group
block
of
relat
data
togeth
charact
devic
realli
don
t
store
data
as
much
as
they
send
it
off
and
forget
about
it
the
process
is
pure
electr
rather
than
electr
and
physic
the
serial
port
for
exampl
send
data
in
a
stream
to
your
palm
pilot
the
storag
of
the
data
is
actual
handl
by
the
palm
itself
not
a
physic
storag
devic
on
the
comput
there
s
no
need
to
spin
up
a
drive
and
account
for
the
data
as
is
necessari
with
a
hard
drive
the
palm
will
also
send
a
signal
back
to
the
comput
confirm
receipt
of
data
that
s
an
indic
that
charact
devic
often
commun
in
both
direct
as
well
so
when
you
re
configur
block
devic
in
your
kernel
you
re
prepar
the
system
for
commun
with
a
devic
that
will
buffer
data
to
a
predetermin
level
then
write
that
data
as
a
block
chang
the
physic
properti
of
the
hard
drive
disc
surfac
even
though
that
s
the
highest
level
view
of
the
process
it
still
show
how
difficult
a
process
physic
data
storag
realli
is
in
the
block
devic
section
you
ll
find
mani
option
for
physic
data
storag
when
configur
thi
section
it
s
crucial
to
know
as
much
about
your
exist
hardwar
as
possibl
what
type
brand
of

are
you
use
what

etc
where
is
