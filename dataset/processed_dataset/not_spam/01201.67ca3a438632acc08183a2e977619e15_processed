simpl
is
right
out
one
of
the
thing
you
need
to
understand
with
gnome

is
that
while
they
did
simplifi
a
lot
of
thing
most
of
the
configur
option
peopl
found

like
the

you
can
t

myself
i
think
you
need
to
understand
that
simplifi
the
configur
option
and
the
ui
doe
make
it
a
lot
easier
to
use
for
peopl
who
are
either
not
use
it
all
the
time
or
are
just
start
to
use
it
the
gnome
team
decid
that
advanc
user
who
want
to
edit
the
kind
of
option
you
talk
about
are
advanc
enough
to
use
gconf

person
i
m
fine
