heh
i
suck
out
all
the
wordinfo
key
that
began
with

the
last

there
wa
probabl
due
to
unrel
instanc
of
the
string
header
in
messag
bodi
harder
to
guess
about
the
first
line
some
header
of
cours
are
total
unreli
as
to
their
origin
i
m
think
stuff
like
mime

content
type

etc
everyon
stick
those
in
the
brillianc
of

s
just
count

scheme
is
that
it
requir
no

so
can
t
be
fool
header
line
that
are
evenli
distribut
across
spam
and
ham
will
turn
out
to

indic
prob
near

do
no
