i
m

play
with
gnuboy
game
boy
emul
as
it
fairli
simpl
and
small
i
m
have
a
few
problem
with
the
doc
macro
after
read
thru
maximum
rpm
and
the
rpm
doc
i
m
still
stuck
on
one
thing
in
the
sourc
for
gnuboy
there
is
a
directori
call
doc
that
contain
well
the
doc
i
m
not
sure
what
to
pass
to
the
doc
macro
i
origin
tri
doc
chang
config
credit
faq
hack
liberti
readm
old
and
it
moan
about
miss
file
would
i
have
to
put
a
few
line
in
the
build
macro
just
befor
configur
to
move
the
doc
out
of
that
directori
and
into
the
build
root
ie
mv
doc
actual
i
ve
alreadi
rebuild
gnuboy
i
just
had
forgotten
to
commit
the
spec
file
which
is
now
done
httpaddr
basic
doc
is
use
to
put
file
in
docdir
default
to
usr
share
doc
name
version
and
the
list
file
with
rel
path
i
e
that
don
t
start
with
a
are
rel
to
the
builddir
the
uncompress
sourc
usual
so
either
you
can
choos
to
have
a
doc
directori
insid
docdir
by
put
doc
doc
or
total
equival
the
latter
just
remind
it
s
a
directori
doc
doc
or
you
can
put
all
file
that
are
in
doc
directli
in
docdir
doc
doc
tri
both
poke
around
and
you
should
catch
the
differ
if
it
s
not
alreadi
clear
for
you
you
can
also
mark
ani
file
from
the
buildroot
as
document
will
be
list
when
use
qd
to
queri
the
packag
s
doc
by
use
doc
with
absolut
filenam
for
exampl
doc
datadir
foo
game
manual
thi
is
usr
share
foo
game
manual
an
absolut
file
also
for
the
packag
s
conveni
all
file
in
usr
share
man
aka
mandir
are
automat
tag
as
doc
also
one
more
thing
what
the
best
way
to
work
out
the
depend
as
for
exampl
with
gnuboy
all
hte
doc
and
the
websit
say
is
it
need
sdl
do
i
set
a
requir
sdl
number
number
as
my
system
use
sdl
number
number
number
number
or
just
put
requir
sdl
build
the
packag
onc
and
see
if
it
check
for
a
specif
version
or
read
the
instal
note
often
you
ll
see
check
for
sdl
number
number
number
for
exampl
when
run
configur
then
it
s
best
to
also
make
the
packag
depend
on
that
version
one
more
quick
question
i
m
use
to
compil
sourc
code
no
problem
cannot
program
but
stumbl
through
what
the
best
way
for
find
out
what
rpm
are
need
for
the
requir
buildrequir
macro
apart
from
read
all
the
doc
and
websit
info
well
read
the
doc
inde
you
can
also
compil
the
packag
onc
without
those
field
and
see
what
the
configur
script
is
check
for
basic
the
lib
and
version
you
ll
need
to
add
to
the
buildrequir
then
onc
the
packag
is
built
queri
the
automat
depend
that
rpm
put
into
it
you
ll
see
for
instanc
if
the
binari
lib
from
the
packag
need
sdl
gtk
etc
then
add
those
requir
and
rebuild
a
final
version
of
the
packag
often
you
can
omit
some
depend
for
exampl
if
a
program
is
check
for
glib
gtk
gdk
pixbuf
and
gnome
librari
when
be
compil
buildrequir
gnome
lib
devel
requir
gnome
lib
will
be
enough
sinc
they
alreadi
depend
on
the
lower
level
lib
that
are
glib
gtk
and
gdk
pixbuf
onc
again
sorri
to
bother
you
with
thi
but
i
figur
you
were
the
best
one
to
ask
well
thi
is
typic
the
type
of
inform
interest
to
share
with
other
so
i
ll
copi
thi
answer
to
the
rpm
list
hope
some
peopl
will
appreci
