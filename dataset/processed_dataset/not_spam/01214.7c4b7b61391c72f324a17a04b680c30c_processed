recommend
tri
to
upgrad

releas
either
simpli
backup
your

root

reinstal
cleanli
it
ll
probabl
save
a
few
hassl
and
you
ll
get
the
cleanest
possibl
system
i
think
thi
is
probabl
the
best
way
becaus
i
think
mayb
with
upgrad
you
do
not
alway
automat
get
the
latest
featur
enabl
in
some
config
file
becaus
rh
would
rather
take
it
easi
and
not
updat
that
config
file
you
get
a
rpmnew
instead
of
rpmsave
file
so
they
get
less
call
to
support
that
way
anyway
i
have
ton
of
media
file
in
home

cdrom
take
