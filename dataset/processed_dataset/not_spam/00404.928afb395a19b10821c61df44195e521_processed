done
ani
idea
whi
my
suspicion
is
that
i
ve
a
lack
of
knowledg
about
how
initrd
work
so
i
m
not
sure
it
s
load
it
for
a
start
the
filesystem
is
be
mount
as
ext
number
at
first
not
ext
number
it
doe
seem
mount
as
ext
number
after
the
fsck
is
done
but
that
mean
that
it
s
mount
as
ext
number
read
onli
fsck
ed
and
then
remount
ext
number
lose
the
point
of
it
given
i
can
t
pass
the
kernel
paramet
i
think
how
then
can
i
get
it
to
load
