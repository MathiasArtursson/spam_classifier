some

into

httpaddr
a

co
number
concentr
and
temperatur
over
hundr
of
thousand

have
shown
a
modest
correl
between
the
two
in
a
number
of
case
co
number
level
increas
are
not
in
phase
with
temperatur
increas
and
actual
trail
the

by

i

increas

increas
in

the
more
studi
that
are
done
of
the
geolog
record
the
more
it
seem
that
co

concentr
are
correl
with
temperatur
increas
but
are
not
significantli
caus
base
on
the
vostok
data
you
are
right
there
is
a
veri
strong
correl
between
temperatur
and
co
number
concentr
but
it
doesn
t
alway
appear
to
be
causal
with
respect
to
absolut
co
number
concentr
it
is
also
import
to
point
out
that
our
best
data
to
date
suggest
that
they
follow
a
fairli
regular
cycl
with
a
period
of
about
number
number
year
also
correct
the
peak
of
each
cycl
is
at
about
number
number
ppm
co
number
as
it
happen
current
co
number
concentr
are
within
number
of
other
previou
cyclic
concentr
peak
for
which
we
have
good
data
not
correct
mauna
loa
data
and
show
that
the
current
co

are
at

greater
than
the

everi

much
faster
than

increas
in
the

data
though
perhap
the
vostok
data
isn
t
capabl
of
such
fine
resolut
in
other
word
we
may
be
ad
to
the

no
we
are
definit

look

the

not

the
co

over

unpreced
in
the
vostok

it
is
clear
that
the
rate
of

is

not
decreas
there
is
no
other
compel

for
thi

except
for

if
you

thi

it
look
a

like
we
would
be
build
a
molehil
on

of
a
mountain
in
the
histor
record
at
the
veri
least
there
is
noth
anomal
about
current
co

concentr
wrong
again
current
co
number
level
are
current
unpreced
over
the
past
number
k
year
unless
there
is
some
mechan
that
allow
co
number
level
to
quickli
spike
and
then
return
back
to
normal
background
level
and
henc
the
spike
might
not
show
up
in
the
ice
core
still
by
around
number
number
we
will
have
reach
number

co

a

that
even
you
would

a
hard

also
co

the

thi
is

be

we
