which
actual

for

befor

cd
technolog
the
thing
is
the
music
industri
is
well
awar
of
thi
effect
and
they
are
not
realli
aim
to
stop
the
privat
exchang
of
song
in

number
format
if
that
were
their
goal
they
d
be
institut
widespread
aggress
legal

node
as
they
did
against
all

play

s
when
they
realli
thought
the

wa
go

focus
on
the
best

servic
first
napster
then
morpheu
kazaa
and
most
recent
audiogalaxi
even
in
those
case
they
ve
limit
their
legal
challeng
to
thing
they
know
they
can
win
and
they
ve
avoid
actual
court
trial
whenev
possibl
to
avoid
the
possibl
of
set
some
damag
preced
the
point
that
seem
to
escap
a
lot
of
peopl
is
that
copyright
is
not
a
properti
in
the
same
sens
as
most
of
the
thing
we
think
of
as
properti
one
key
differ
is
that
if
you
don
t
defend
it
you
lose
it
if
you
left
your
car
sit
in
the
driveway
with
the
window
open
and
the
key
in
the
ignit
and
somebodi
drove
away
in
it
that
would
still
be
theft
and
you
d
still
be
entitl
to
get
your
car
back
not
so
with
copyright
if
you
are
awar
of
infring
and
you
do
noth
to
tri
to
stop
it
you
are
voluntarili
allow
it
to
enter
the
public
domain
it
s
for
the
same
reason
that
big
compani
insist
that
newspap
put
a
copyright
or
trademark
symbol
after
the
name
of
their
product
whenev
they
re
mention
and
not
use
word
like
coke
or
kleenex
as
gener
term
they
don
t
realli
expect
everybodi
to
do
what
they
say
and
they
re
well
awar
that
have
the
name
of
one
s
product
becom
the
gener
term
for
a
product
is
actual
a
great
market
boon
but
if
they
don
t
do
that
someon
at
some
point
could
start
use
the
word
on
their
own
product
argu
that
it
is
in
the
public
domain
the
effort
of
the
music
industri
are
not
aim
at
actual
stop
the
exchang
of
music
between
individu
which
they
know
from
long
experi
increas
their
sale
becaus
most
of
the
peopl
who
normal
buy
the
music
aren
t
realli
satisfi
with
near
perfect
copi
for
most
of
them
the
learn
curv
and
the
cost
in
time
of
creat
those
copi
themselv
outweigh
the
cost
of
simpli
buy
the
cd
most
of
the
outright
piraci
is
commit
by
peopl
who
wouldn
t
have
bought
the
music
in
the
first
place
what
the
music
industri
is
do
is
clearli
aim
at
establish
a
public
record
of
their
effort
to
defend
copyright
in
the
broadest
most
public
way
to
prevent
anyon
from
make
a
legal
claim
that
the
stuff
they
own
ha
enter
the
public
domain
the
thing
they
re
realli
worri
about
in
term
of
profit
is
the
chang
in
the
market
model
even
legitim
onlin

of
other
most
peopl
wouldn
t
pay
for
if
they
were

song

the
problem
is
how
to
make
as
much
money
on

at
the
moment
it
requir
charg
far
more
for

that

are
will
to

actual
a
fairli
complex
matter
of
civil

good
