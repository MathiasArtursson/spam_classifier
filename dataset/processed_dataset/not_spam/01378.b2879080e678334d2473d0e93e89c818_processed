the
habea
infring
list
hil
exist
explicitli
to
deal
with
spammer
while
we
re
get
judgment
against
them
and
especi
in
other
countri
where
those

harder
to
get
pleas
note
that
nobodi

an
incent
befor
to
go
after
regular
spammer
ye
some
attorney
gener
have
prosecut
blatant
pyramid
scheme
and
isp
have
won
some
theft
of
servic
suit
but
the
vast
major
of
spammer
go
forward
with
out
ani
legal
hassl
so
i
can
t
understand
how
daniel
can
assert
that
you
can
t
track
spammer
down
when
it
s
never
realli
been
tri
we
can
subpoena
the
record
of
the

of
we
can
subpoena
the
record
of
the
isp
that
provid
them
servic
and
of
the
credit
card
they
use
for
the
whack
a
mole
account
we
can
use
privat
investig
ye
these
peopl
are
often
lowlif
chickenbon
but
they
re
not
secret
agent
they
re
just
tri
to
make
a
buck
and
habea
whole
busi
is
about
find
them
and
put
them
out
of
busi
habea
ha
the
incent
to
pursu
spammer
that
use
our
warrant
mark
in
a
way
that
no
one
ever
ha
had
befor
given
that
our
whole
busi
plan
reli
on
habea
becom
synonym
with
not

i
can
t
understand
whi
you
would
assum
ahead
of
time
that
we
will
be

failur
and
in
so
do
remov
