hi
kragen
thi
is
an
interest
analysi
i
think
that
there
are
a
coupl
of
nit
i
might
pick
for
exampl
i
don
t
expect
that
the
market
will
be
well
develop
with
highest
bidder
for
while
i
think
that
the
most
import
issu
which
is
that
end
user
won
t
be
abl
to
fix
their
system
is
almost
pass
over
i
know
that
you
know
thi
and
you
allud
to
it
but
your
essay
is
get
pass
around
so
you
might
want
to
add
to
it
bit
about
the
sysadmin
and
other
there
s
one
other
point
which
you
don
t
make
which
i
think
is
veri
import
which
is
that
research
into
defin
and
address
class
of
vulner
can
t
happen
without
librari
of
avail
vulner
code
i
can
think
of
three
research
into
autom
method
for
address
vulner
who
gripe
uninvit
about
the
qualiti
of
the
exist
vulner
site
do
research
into
a
set
requir
that
you
have
enough
exampl
in
the
open
that
you
can
defin
a
set
and
that
the
set
is
ad
to
from
time
to
time
so
you
can
make
and
test
predict
i
feel
fairli
confid
in
say
that
without
full
disclosur
we
wouldn
t
have
stackguard
it
number
nissu
or
snort
and
the
secur
admin
s
job
would
be
a

which
bill
itself
as

is
offer

that

especi
if

promis
not

thi

it
will
pose
a

seriou
threat
to

at

the

paradigm
for
comput
secur
research
known
as
full
disclosur
peopl
who
discov
secur
vulner
in
softwar
tell
the
vendor
about
them
and
a
short
while
later
after
the
vendor
ha
had
a
chanc
to
fix
the
problem
they
publish
the
inform
includ
code
to
exploit
the
vulner
if
possibl
thi
method
ha
proven
far
superior
to
the
old
paradigm
establish
by
cert
in
the
late
number
s
which
it
propon
might
call
respons
disclosur
never
releas
work
exploit
code
and
never
releas
ani
inform
on
the
vulner
befor
all
vendor
have
releas
a
patch
thi
procedur
often
left
hundr
of
thousand
of
comput
vulner
to
known
bug
for
month
or
year
while
the
vendor
work
on
featur
and
often
even
after
the
patch
were
releas
peopl
wouldn
t
appli
them
becaus
they
didn
t
know
how
seriou
the
problem
wa
the
underground
comput
crimin
commun
would
often
discov
and
exploit
these
same
hole
for
month
or
year
while
the
respons
disclosur
process
kept
their
victim
who
had
no
connect
in
the
underground
vulner
the
problem
with
thi
is
that
vulner
that
are
wide
known
are
much
less
danger
becaus
their
victim
can
take
step
to
reduc
their
potenti
impact
includ
disabl
softwar
turn
off
vulner
featur
filter
traffic
in
transit
and
detect
and
respond
to
intrus
they
are
therefor
much
less
use
to
would
be
intrud
also
softwar
compani
usual
see
secur
vulner
in
their
softwar
as
pr
problem
and
so
prefer
to
delay
public
and
the
expens
of
fix
the
bug
as
long
as
possibl
idefens
is
offer
a
new
altern
that
appear
far
more
danger
than
either
of
the
two
previou
paradigm
they
want
to
be
a
buyer
in
a
marketplac
for
secret
softwar
vulner
inform
reward
discover
of
vulner
with
cash
not
long
befor
snosoft
a
group
of
secur
research
evid
includ
some
crimin
element
appar
made
an
offer
to
sell
the
secreci
of
some

consid

snosoft
publish

if

it
will
caus
two
problem
which
togeth
add
up
to
a
catastroph
first
secret
softwar
vulner
inform
will
be
avail
to
the
highest
bidder
and
to
nobodi
els
for
reason
explain
later
i
think
the
highest
bidder
will
gener
be
organ
crime
syndic
although
that
will
not
be
obviou
to
the
seller
second
find
softwar
vulner
and
keep
them
secret
will
becom
lucr
for
mani
more
talent
peopl
the
result
will
be
just
as
in
the
respons
disclosur
day
that
the
good
guy
will
remain
vulner
for
month
and
year
while
the
major
of
current
vulner
are
kept
secret
i
ve
heard
it
argu
that
the
highest
bidder
will
gener
be
the
vendor
of
the
vulner
softwar
but
i
don
t
think
that
s
plausibl
if
someon
can
steal
dollar
number
number
becaus
a
softwar
bug
let
them
the
softwar
vendor
is
never
held
liabl
often
in
fact
the
peopl
who
administ
the
softwar
aren
t
liabl
either
when
credit
card
data
are
stolen
from
an
e
commerc
site
for
exampl
know
about
a
vulner
befor
anyon
els
might
save
a
web
site
administr
some
time
and
it
might
save
the
softwar
vendor
some
neg
pr
but
it
can
net
the
thief
thousand
of
dollar
i
think
the
highest
bidder
will
be
those
for
whom
earli
vulner
inform
is
most
lucr
the
thiev
who
can
use
it
to
execut
the
largest
heist
without
get
caught
inevit
that
mean
organ
crime
syndic
although
the
particular
gang
who
are
good
at
network
theft
may
not
yet
exist
there
might
be
the
occasion
case
where
a
market
leader
such
as
microsoft
could
make
more
money
by
give
their
competitor
bad
pr
than
a

think
