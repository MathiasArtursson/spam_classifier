i
thought
it
wa
gpl
ed
and
that
the
money
you
paid
suse
wa
for
your
number
day
support
or
whatev
ye
you
re
confus
i
wa
confus
a
linux
distribut
ani
linux
distribut
contain
lot
and
lot
of
separ
codebas
some
are
under
the
gnu
gpl
mani
are
not
inde
that
i
actual
had
understood
prior
to
all
thi
for
exampl
commerci
entiti
with
trial
limit
crippl
edit
which
is
no
problem
i
don
t
see
whi
that
should
be
a
problem
for
suse
though
sure
the
more
the
merrrier
as
far
as
they
re
concern
are
you
clear
on
thi
point
now
vide
supra
thi
is
my
second
tri
mighti
white
of
you
old
bean
one
suspect
that
you
actual
understand
perfectli
but
just
don
t
like
it
one
can
suspect
what
one
like
what
i
didn
t
understand
wa
that
suse
had
proprietari
extens
that
it
wasn
t
prepar
to
allow
peopl
to
use
under
the
gpl
or
even
under
a
freebsd
style
licenc
i
thought
that
the
model
for
the
like
of
suse
wa
sell
support
and
customis
rather
than
what
i
thought
of
as
the
core
product
i
thought
that
the
like
of
yast
came
under
core
mayb
it
work
in
the
glori
day
befor
say
number
i
can
understand
that
they
might
want
to
make
more
money
but
the
way
in
which
they
have
done
it
seem
to
me
to
be
be
against
the
spirit
of
the
gpl
you
re
further
confus
if
you
think
the
gnu
gpl
give
you
the
right
to
get
cover
softwar
for
free
it
doe
not
all
i
want
is
the
os
and
gnu
app
i
wa
under
the
impress
that
for
those
all
one
need
wa
to
pay
for
the
media
and
not
for
the
code
itself
ai
je
tort
it
provid
that
if
you
ve
law
receiv
a
copi
of
the
cover
binari
version
you
have
right
to
also
receiv
the
match
sourc
code
my
understand
wa
that
binari
or
whatev
could
be
receiv
for
the
cost
of
the
media
plu
a
token
of
one
s
appreci
the
latter
be
subject
to
agreement
between
the
parti
i
wa
offer
a
bottl
of
wine
plu
mayb
a
pint
or
two
and
a
chat
for
a
copi
i
don
t
know
what
the
go
rate
is
if
i
want
support
from
suse
that
would
be
a
differ
issu
and
one
for
which
i
would
be
will
to
pay
i
don
t
particularli
need
support
so
i
m
no
realli
interest
in
purchas
a
set
of
disk
with
number
billion
app
which
i
ll
never
use
then
if
you
nonetheless
want
a
suse
box
set
s
content
the
onli
way
you
can
do
that
without
copyright
violat
and
without
have
to
pay
the
purchas
price
is
to
get
someon
to
give
not
lend
or
duplic
you
hi
copi
i
have
a
friend
with
number
number
i
think
that
i
ll
end
up
do
that
seem
to
me
to
go
against
the
spirit
of
the
gpl
though
ye
thank
for
your
input
anyway
i
ve
a
friend
with

ask
