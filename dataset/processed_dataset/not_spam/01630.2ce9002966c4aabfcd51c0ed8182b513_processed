develop
some

code
to
allow
custom

set
n
up
booklet

etc
to
be
save
up
to
the

to
be
retriev
by
other
user
the
data
is
be
written

let
me
get
thi
straight
a
registri
key
is
load
from
the
server
onto
the
client
workstat
who
can
modifi
it
then
write
it
back
onto
the
server
s
own
registri
which
is
not
go
to
use
it
the
question
is
what
are
the
secur
risk
of
allow
user
to
write
to
thi
key
the
data
is
string
data
in
the
form
of
delimit
numer
valu
thi
data
is
then
retriev
by
capabl
printer
driver
and
interpret
the
risk
as
i
see
it
are
twofold
number
the
risk
of
a
compromis
to
the
server
use
thi
registri
key
i
think
thi
is
unlikeley
as
the
server
itself
doe
not
use
thi
data
onli
client
pc
s
do
unless
someon
know
a
way
to
travel
out
of
a
hive
up
the
registri
bypass
the
permiss
set
use
regedt
number
what
is
the
reason
to
write
a
registri
key
to
a
server
if
the
server
itself
is
not
use
it
i
don
t
think
you
should
worri
too
much
about
someon
travel
out
of
the
hive
but
again
i
m
curiou
as
to
how
the
driver
actual
modifi
the
key
on
the
server
number
the
risk
of
a
compromis
to
the
client
far
more
like
thi
would
probabl
be
by
a
malform
or
extrem
long
string
in
the
key
valu
which
would
presum
lead
to
either
do
or
system
compromis
by
buffer
overflow
on
the
client
system
and
if
the
client
write
the
key
back
onto
the
server
ye
there
s
wide
open
for
someth
nasti
here
two
other
thing
spring
to
mind
number
if
anyon
can
modifi
the
key
how
do
you
make
sure
that
two
user
are
not
overwrit
the
same
key
therebi
caus
undesir
effect
number
if
anyon
have
permiss
to
write
to
the
key
and
below
anyon
can
creat
thousand
of
extra
key
under
thi
key
therebi
fill
up
the
registri
the
result
of
such
a
thing
is
obviou
if
i
got
thi
all
wrong
i
d
be
happi
that
you
clarifi
a
bit
more
and
tell
me
where
i
might
have
misunderstood
