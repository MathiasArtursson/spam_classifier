my
feel
of
thi
is
that
we
realli
do
not
want
to
have
a
ftoc
clearcurr
but
rather
just
a
rescanlin
and
the
caller
had
better
know
the
line
or
msgid
that
routin
shoud
just
put
in
the
if
the
line
msg
in
question
happen
to
be
the
cur
msg
thought
intuit
that
sound
right
to
me
it
doe
also
call
tag
remov
so
you
ll
have
to
make
sure
that
get
set
correctli
as
well
i
think
ani
chang
that
make
it
behav
more
intuit
are
a
good
thing
even
if
they
mean
we
have
someth
els
to
fix
of
cours
that
attitud
is
whi
i
ve
been
fix
exmh
bug
for
number
week
i
just
check
in
a
code
cleanup
which
doesn
t
address
thi
issu
but
doe
take
a
machet
to
code
right
around
it
you
ought
to
cv
updat
and
see
if
your
issu
becom
ani
clearer
with
all
the
brush
remov
my
patch
note
that
msgid
and
line
are
redund
with
one
anoth
and
remov
one
or
the
other
from
function
which
take
both
the
caller
are
then
chang
to
pass
what
the
function
expect
in
the
case
of
msg
chang
the
line
argument
is
remov
and
we
onli
have
the
msgid
argument
ftoc
clearcurr
is
now
the
first
line
of
msgchang
