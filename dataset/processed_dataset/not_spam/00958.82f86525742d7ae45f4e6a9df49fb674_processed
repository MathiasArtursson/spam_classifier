i
have
some
patch
that
seem
to
fix
avoid
thi
problem
now
it
is
amaz
what
one
can
achiev
when
main
power
fail
long
enough
for
up
s
to
run
out
and
all
that
is
left
oper
is
the
laptop
and
it
batteri
suppli
first
i
put
in
some
defens
code
into
the
area
where
the
problem
wa
occur
so
that
if
exmh
is
attempt
for
ani
reason
to
expand
a
sequenc
that
isn
t
either
a
number
or
a
rang
of
number
or
a
list
of
such
thing
it
will
simpli
ignor
the
trash
rather
than
give
a
traceback
thi
one
solv
the
initi
problem

number
lappend
seq
dollar
part
that
is
amend
proc
mhseqexpand
which
is
where
the
error
wa
occur
befor
the
code
assum
that
dollar
rang
is
either
nnn
or
nnn
mmm
so
we
should
probabl
make
sure
that
s
true
issu
an
error
instead
of
just
continu
if
you
like
but
i
don
t
think
an
error
is
need
but
that
just
allow
me
to
creat
a
similar
problem
in
anoth
place
by
type
nnn
and
rather
than
continu
to
fight
fire
like
thi
i
thought
i
should
think
more
about
brent
s
suggest
but
rather
than
have
the
select
code
actual
valid
the
input
which
would
mean
it
would
have
to
know
what
is
to
be
valid
i
decid
that
the
right
thing
to
do
is
just
to
ignor
ani
error
caus
by
invalid
input
so
i
just
stuck
a
catch
around
the
msgshow
that
is
process
the
nonsens
that
the
user
ha
type
thi
way
ani
later
expans
to
what
msgshow
treat
as
legal
mayb
allow
a
sequenc
name
like
prev
or
next
or
anyth
els
can
be
handl
just
there
without
someon
need
to
rememb
that
they
have
to
go
fix
the
select
process
code
to
allow
it
but
while
i
wa
play
there
i
notic
someth
i
never
new
befor
if
you
type
number
the
number
chang
to
number
and
so
on
for
each
that
is
type
i
suspect
that
s
perhap
an
artifact
of
is
bound
to
a
differ
function
so
it
can
be
use
as
a
toggl
between
chang
the
current
and
the
target
folder
but
it
ha
to
mean
someth
if
the
current
input
mode
is
a
messag
number
so
let
it
mean
but
now
i
found
it
i
think
it
nice
but
if
we
can
type
number
whi
not
number
as
well
that
kind
of
limit
bug
me
so
i
fix
it
and
then
i
wonder
about
folder
with
name
contain
the
special
use
of
as
the
toggl
charact
mean
there
s
no
way
to
type
those
from
the
keyboard
so
i
fix
that
as
well
thi
make
two
differ
restrict
there
s
no
way
to
type
a
folder
name
that
ha
a
name
begin
with
but
such
a
thing
in
mh
would
be
a
pain
to
use
anyway
so
i
doubt
thi
will
bother
anyon
and
it
is
now
onli
possibl
to
toggl
between
type
the
current
target
folder
name
when
the
name
be
type
is
empti
i
m
less
happi
about
that
part
but
i
think
i
can
live
with
it
in
order
to
allow
folder
name
with
s
in
them
to
exist
and
be
type
then
sinc
i
wa
there
anyway
i
decid
to
do
someth
about
anoth
featur
that
ha
alway
bug
me
in
normal
keyboard
mode
s
is
the
key
use
to
show
a
messag
but
if
you
ve
just
type
number
and
the
ftoc
is
highlight
number
as
the
current
messag
and
you
want
to
now
show
that
messag
you
can
t
type
s
you
have
to
type
r
instead
so
i
fix
thi
one
as
well
fix
here
is
in
quot
as
it
assum
that
the
keybind
for
msgshow
is
s
if
you
chang
that
to
someth
els
it
will
remain
s
in
here
i
don
t
know
enough
tk
tcl
to
have
it
discov
what
key
is
bound
to
a
function
in
the
extern
world
in
order
to
bind
the
same
one
here
r
continu
to
work
of
cours
and
now
i
got
start
in
fix
irrit
in
thi
code
i
also
made
it
clear
the
statu
line
if
you
abort
messag
folder
entri
mode
c
or
g
previous
it
use
to
leav
the
prompt
sit
there
until
the
next
messag
appear
which
made
it
less
than
obviou
that
the
keyboard
had
revert
to
it
usual
bind
in
ani
case
what
follow
is
the
patch
that
doe
all
of
that
i
believ
that
if
you
appli
thi
then
the
one
abov
is
probabl
not
need
the
catch
around
the
msgshow
will
hide
the
problem
i
don
t
think
we
realli
need
to
fix
brent
s
way
of
invok
it
or
includ
it
anyway
just
for
complet
i
haven
t
run
an
exmh
with
the
follow
patch
but
not
the
previou
one
so
i
don
t
know
for
sure
that
all
will
be
ok
