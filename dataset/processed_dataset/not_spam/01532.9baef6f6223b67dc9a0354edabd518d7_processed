i

rsync
is

and
it
dq
allow
you
to
select
which

you
want
just
as
well
as
wget
would
dq
bandwidth
is
a
much
bigger
issu
for
me
and
some
other
of

dq
involv

it
would
be
for

guy
imo
it
s
by

the
most

way
to
do
thi
stuff
these

dq
dq
it
must

be
a

in

if
we
can
autom
dq
rsync
submiss
with
good
authent
it
would
be
fine
with
me
dq
the
current
rsync
method
is
not
suffici
authent
though
i
ll
take
a

at
it
i
m
sure
there
s
got
to
be
some
reasonli
easi
way
to
have
rsync
carri
itself
over
ssh
and
secur
access
use
ssh
key
dq
i
suggest
we
use
the
hugh
famili
org
server
for
rsync
as
we
do
for
dq
the
corpu
submit
stuff
in
a
separ

i

take
