so
then
tim
peter
is
all
like
guido
i
don
t
know
how
big
that
pickl
would
be
mayb
load
it
each
time
is
fine
or
mayb
marshal
my
test
train
on
about
number
number
msg
and
a
binari
pickl
of
the
databas
is
approach
number
million
byte
my
paltri
number
messag
train
set
make
a
number
number
mb
where
number
mb
number
e
number
byte
pickl
hammi
py
which
i
just
check
in
will
option
let
you
write
stuff
out
to
a
dbm
file
with
that
same
messag
base
the
dbm
file
weigh
in
at
a
hefti
number
number
mb
it
also
take
longer
to
write
use
a
databas
real
number
m
number
number

sy

m
number
number

thi
is
on
a
piii
at
number
number
mhz
i
don
t
know
what
it
s
suppos
to
be
number
number
is
what
proc
cpuinfo
say
for
comparison
spamoracl
current
the
gold
standard
in
my
mind
at
least
for
speed
on
the
same
data
blaze
along
real
number
m
number
number
s
user
number
m
number
number
s
sy
number
m
number
number
s
it
data
file
which
appear
to
be
a
marshal
hash
is
number
kb
howev
it
s
compil
o
caml
and
it
use
a
much
simpler
token
algorithm
written
with
a
lexic
analyz
ocamllex
so
we
ll
never
be
abl
to
outperform
it
it
s
someth
to
keep
in
mind
though
i
don
t
have
statist
yet
for
scan
unknown
messag
actual
i
do
and
the
databas
blow
the
pickl
out
of
the
water
but
it
score
everi
word
with
number
number
so
i
m
not
sure
that
s
a
fair
test
in
ani
case
number
mb
per
user
is
probabl
too
larg
and
number
mb
is
question
on
the
other
hand
my
pickl
compress
veri
well
with
gzip
shrink
down
to
number
number
mb
