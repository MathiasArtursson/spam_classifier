well
i
ve
use
the
check
the
modifi
time
cach
trick
for
file
in
mani
place
not
just
exmh
so
some
part
of
me
certainli
think
it
is
effect
howev
it
occur
to
me
that
if
we
do
checkpoint
state
then
aren
t
we
modifi
the
sequenc
file
for
the
current
folder
on
everi
messag
read
perhap
we
look
at
the
sequenc
file
more
than
onc
per
messag
view
as
i
d
written
the
code
a
few
month
ago
we
were
read
the
sequenc
file
first
to
see
what
sequenc
were
in
it
and
then
onc
per
sequenc
thi
happen
anywher
that
we
look
at
sequenc
most
notabl
in
ftoc
showsequ
that
seem
to
be
an
obviou
lose
performancewis
but
i
want
my
abstract
to
have
a
separ
call
for
what
sequenc
are
in
thi
folder
and
what
messag
are
in
thi
sequenc
one
option
would
have
been
to
add
anoth
call
to
get
the
data
off
of
disk
but
i
felt
that
the
check
the
modifi
time
techniqu
would
be
less
error
prone
i
think
the
biggest
gain
would
be
from
augment
ftoc
showsequ
to
allow
a
finer
specif
of
what
need
to
be
updat
in
the
ftoc
so
that
the
current
code
would
onli
be
run
when
we
realli
do
have
to
updat
all
sequenc
for
all
messag
i
describ
these
thought
in
an
email
messag
yesterday
and
again
if
it
can
wait
a
few
week
i
m
will
to
do
it
