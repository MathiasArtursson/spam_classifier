hi
i
wa
inspir
by
a
mode
of
oper
support
by
vmware
you
can
have
a
base
disk
imag
share
by
multipl
virtual
machin
vm
instanc
that
base
imag
is
never
alter
by
a
vm
instanc
instead
each
vm
instanc
write
chang
to
it
own
redo
log
futur
hard
disk
read
from
that
vm
instanc
incorpor
both
the
base
imag
and
the
appropri
redo
log
to
present
the
current
disk
imag
for
that
specif
virtual
machin
thi
is
describ
here
thank
to
duan
for
provid
thi
link
on
the
honeypot
mail
list
httpaddr
could
thi
basic
concept
be
use
to
easili
make
self
fix
client
server
applic
that
effici
and
automat
recov
from
most
attack
even
befor
those
attack
have
been
discov
here
is
what
i
imagin
the
physic
architectur
of
most
product
client
server
system
are
layer
for
exampl
your
basic
web
applic
might
have
a
web
server
run
apach
connect
to
an
applic
server
run
some
j
number
ee
or
net
busi
logic
connect
to
a
databas
server
for
persist
the
onli
one
of
these
whose
disk
imag
realli
should
evolv
over
time
is
the
databas
server
and
even
here
you
often
put
the
static
rdbm
softwar
on
one
partit
and
the
changeabl
datafil
on
anoth
partit
it
is
onli
the
partit
with
the
volatil
datafil
that
must
be
allow
to
chang
from
one
boot
to
the
next
other
parit
may
need
to
be
writabl
for
say
swap
space
but
these
chang
could
be
elimin
on
each
reboot
when
someon
crack
thi
system
they
will
probabl
chang
an
imag
that
shouldn
t
be
chang
e
g
they
might
leverag
a
buffer
overflow
in
ii
or
apach
to
instal
a
trojan
or
a
backdoor
on
the
more
expos
web
server
but
what
if
the
web
server
ran
off
a
base
imag
write
chang
to
a
delta
or
redo
partit
and
then
what
if
everi
night
it
automat
eras
the
redo
partit
and
reboot
the
downtim
involv
for
each
machin
would
be
minim
becaus
it
is
onli
delet
data
rather
than
restor
from
backup
in
a
system
with
redund
web
server
for
load
balanc
or
high
avail
thi
could
be
schedul
in
a
way
such
that
the
system
is
alway
access
thi
base
redo
partit
concept
could
be
implement
at
the
same
level
as
a
featur
of
hardwar
raid
allow
for
greater
perform
reliabl
and
hack
resist
thi
concept
could
also
be
appli
to
the
applic
server
and
even
the
databas
server
partit
except
for
those
partit
which
contain
the
tabl
data
file
of
cours
doe
anyon
do
thi
alreadi
or
is
thi
a
new
concept
or
ha
thi
concept
been
discuss
befor
and
abandon
for
some
reason
that
i
don
t
yet
know
i
use
the
physic
architectur
of
a
basic
web
applic
as
an
exampl
in
thi
post
but
thi
concept
could
of
cours
be
appli
to
most
server
system
it
would
allow
for
the
hardwar
separ
of
volatil
and
non
volatil
disk
imag
it
would
be
analog
to
perform
nightli
ghost
oper
onli
it
would
be
more
effici
and
involv
less
or
no
downtim
thank
for
ani
