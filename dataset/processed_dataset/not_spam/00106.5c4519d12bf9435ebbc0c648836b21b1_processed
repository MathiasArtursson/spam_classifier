from
stephen
shirley
it
s
veri
easi
to
get
one
program
to
act
on
the
output
of
a
second
program
cmd
number
cmd
number
but
what
if
you
want
cmd
number
to
act
on
the
output
of
cmd
number
as
well
hmm
eventu
i
came
up
with
thi
solut
mkfifo
io
cmd
number
io
and
bingo
all
wa
well
with
the
world
now
i
have
and
had
a
sneak
suspcion
that
it
might
be
possibl
to
do
thi
without
use
a
fifo
and
can
be
done
use
someth
like
number
exec
number
number
number
cmd
number
number
cmd
number
number
number
exec
number
but
that
doesn
t
work
in
that
form
and
i
couldn
t
work
out
an
incant
that
would
anyon
got
ani
suggest
the
abov
or
someth
close
to
it
would
work
if
when
the
number
st
line
is
execut
file
descriptor
fdesc
number
is
open
for
both
read
and
write
r
w
to
a
suitabl
entiti
e
g
a
pipe
fifo
i
imagin
a
socket
or
someth
of
that
ilk
could
be
made
to
work
but
have
no
idea
whi
you
d
want
to
go
to
the
troubl
but
in
ani
case
all
that
is
unlik
to
be
the
case
most
probabl
fdesc
number
is
yer
tti
e
g
screen
keyboard
and
quit
possibl
is
open
onli
for
write
be
stdout
you
need
it
open
for
r
w
becaus
all
dup
number
number
which
is
all
n
m
mean
doe
is
replic
the
fdesc
handl
it
doe
not
chang
the
access
mode
e
g
if
the
origin
fdesc
m
wa
onli
open
for
write
w
that
s
all
the
new
fdesc
n
is
open
for
yet
in
the
number
nd
line
it
s
need
for
both
r
cmd
number
and
w
cmd
number
whilst
it
s
imposs
to
say
for
certain
from
thi
excerpt
it
seem
a
reason
guess
that
fdesc
number
when
the
number
st
line
execut
is
the
stdout
of
the
script
itself
which
is
most
probabl
yer
tti
that
mean
if
it
doe
happen
to
be
open
for
r
w
which
is
the
case
on
some
system
cmd
number
would
be
write
to
the
screen
whilst
cmd
number
is
read
from
the
keyboard
i
e
the
poor
confus
human
luser
is
clearli
expect
to
manual
echo
back
to
the
comput
what
it
print
good
luck
upshot
the
fifo
is
need
and
thi
isn
t
a
shell
script
problem
per
se
the
fifo
solut
is
fine
i
ve

handl
