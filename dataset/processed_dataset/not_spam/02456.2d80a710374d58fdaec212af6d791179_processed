one
of
the
main
strand
of
thi
modernis
is
to
have
all
station
on
a
retain
basi
at
night
basic
thi
mean
that
the
fire
station
will
be
unman
and
in
the
event
of
a
fire
the
fire
fighter
will
be
summons
by
pager
the
same
way
that
they
current
are
in
a
lot
of
rural
region
the
main
reason
for
thi
is
that
fewer
fire
occur
at
night
howev
the
major
of
fatal
in
fire
do
occur
at
night
and
the
recent
death
dure
the
fire
fighter
strike
all
occur
at
night
over
half
of
these
happen
in
area
current
cover
by
retain
crew
who
aren
t
on
strike
and
would
appear
to
give
a
grim
foreshadow
of
what
may
be
to
come
current
one
of
the
condit
for
be
in
a
retain
crew
is
that
you
must
live
work
within
one
mile
of
the
station
how
they
will
appli
thi
to
whole
time
fire
fighter
is
still
unclear
a
good
friend
of
mine
is
a
station
offic
in
hampshir
and
current
live
number
mile
from
hi
station
so
how
he
ll
respond
to
fire
call
at
night
is
a
mysteri
and
i
can
t
see
mani
fire
fighter
live
within
a
mile
of
some
of
the
inner
london
station
