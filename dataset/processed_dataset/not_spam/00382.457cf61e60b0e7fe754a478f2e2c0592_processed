wa
kind
of
shadi
thing
have
got
much
better
you
re
right
in
that
the
jdk
use
to
suck
on
linux
but
then
imho
linux
is
still
matur
or
at
least
develop

are
matur
i
ve
been
develop
a
few
server

you
don

i

robert

if
your
problem
just
requir

a
design

to

then
it
s
trivial
anyway
irrespect
of
languag
wow
so
you
re
tell
me
that
unless
the
applic
involv
bit
count
it
s
trivial
what
about
the
applic
itself
what
about
high
level
problem
such
as
task
distribut
work
flow
etc
aren
t
most
high
level
problem
solv
with
high

solut
like
design
pattern
or
do
you
solv
high

problem
by
write
optim

c
code
for

do
you
think
that
most
peopl
work
on
collabor

there
are
lot
of
them
on
thi
list
are
work
on
write
an

you
appear
to
be

assert
that

low

and
java
programm
don
t
depend
entir
on
the
programm
not
the
languag
i
can
see
how
you
could
infer
thi
howev
what
i
believ
to
realli
be
the
case
is
that
java
is
one
of
the
best
languag
for
write
larg
applic
with
mani
compon
that
involv
the
collabor
of
more
than
three
programm
in
those
case
it
s
alway
veri
hard
to
get
the
programm
to
agre
on
api
s
memori
manag
techniqu
etc
with
java
the
jcp
take
care
of
the
discuss
so
that
you
don
t
sit
around
in
a
long
meet
tri
to
decid
what
api
to
use
to
hook
up
to
a
databas
jdbc
or
a
messag
bu
jm
number
java
is
not
just
a
program
languag
it
s
also
a

buzzword
yike
have
you
written
db
code
with

c
for

databas
just
an
exampl
tri
port
a
persist
layer
from

to
unix
say
you
have
informix
run
on
solari
and
you
want
to
port
to
window
with
ms
sql
bad
idea
but
for
the
sake
of
the
exampl
would
you
rather
deal
with
jdbc
port
or
c
c
port
that
use
informix
driver
and
now
you
have
to
use
odbc
a
monolith
set
of

or
a
crap
load
of
differ

slice
and
dice
the

robert

unsupport
assert
so
are
you

that
there

to
know
if
there
is

accept
by
everyon
who
write
c
c
in

case
i
claim
ignor
not
suggest
that
java
is
the
golden
hammer
just
that
c
c
is
overkil
for
most
thing
i
even
code
in

vb
is
a
true
disgrac
to

it
s
just
lame
java
is
object
orient
no

mail
from
the
anti

peopl
pleas
that
is
a
religi

rel
clean
and
i
don
t
think
that
everi
kid
can
write
a
well
design
java
program
kid
typic
don
t
understand
variou
design
pattern
and
principl
to
my
experi
they
actual
tend
to
think
more
of
the
low
level
problem
want
to
rewrit
and
reinvent
the
world
a
tendenc
that
is
much
more
possibl
imho
in
c
c
than
in
java
due
to
exist
of
standard
api
