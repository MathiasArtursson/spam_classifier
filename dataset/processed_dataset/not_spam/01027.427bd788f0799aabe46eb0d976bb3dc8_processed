i
guess
the
first
question
here
should
be
doe
anyon
have
some
updat
to
the
pgp
code
in
exmh
that
i
should
know
about
my
current
problem
is
that
if
i
get
a
pgp
sign
messag
i
first
get
a
button
that
read
check
the
signatur
with
gnupg
if
i
punch
the
button
and
i
dont
have
the
signatur
on
my
keyr
then
i
get
a
messag
say
just
that
and
the
messag
can
t
check
signatur
public
key
not
found
along
with
a
button
with
the
inscript
queri
keyserv
if
i
punch
the
button
then
exmh
just
hang
forev
if
instead
of
punch
the
button
i
go
out
to
the
keyserv
myself
and
then
tri
the
messag
again
everyth
work
so
it
seem
that
it
must
be
the
code
that
goe
out
to
the
keyserv
anyon
els
with
thi
problem
thi
is
exmh
