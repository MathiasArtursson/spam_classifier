i
d
prefer
to
strip
html
tag
from
everyth
but
last
time
i
tri
that
it
still
had
bad
effect
on
the
error
rate
in
my
corpora
guido
your
corpora
are
bias
in
thi
respect
though
newsgroup
have
a
strong
social
taboo
on
post
html
but
in
mani
peopl
s
person
inbox
it
is
quit
abund
we
re
in
violent
agreement
there
the
comment
in
token
py
say
that
as
strongli
as
possibl
and
i
ve
repeat
it
endlessli
here
too
but
so
long
as
i
wa
the
onli
one
do
seriou
test
it
wa
a
dubiou
idea
to
make
the
code
maxim
clumsi
for
me
to
use
on
the
c
l
py
task
get
a
good
ham
corpu
may
prove
to
be
a
bigger
hurdl
than
i
though
my
own
save
mail
doesn
t
reflect
what
i
receiv
sinc
i
save
and
throw
away
select
much
more
so
than
in
the
past
yup
the

delet
as

and
delet
as

key
would
probabl
work
veri
well
for
motiv
geek
but
paul
svensson
ha
point
out
here
that
they
probabl
wouldn
t
work
nearli
so
well
for
real
peopl
ah
that
explain
whi
the
html
tag
didn
t
get
strip
i
d
again
offer
to
add
an
option
argument
to
token
so
that
they
d
get
strip
here
too
but
if
it
get
gloss
over
a
third
time
that
would
feel
too
much
like
a
loss
