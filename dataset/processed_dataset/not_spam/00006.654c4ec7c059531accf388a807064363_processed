fix
in
cv
second
i
ve
been
use
to
have
a
key
bind
which
wa
to
msg
markunseen
which
doesn
t
seem
to
exist
ani
more
and
i
m
not
sure
what
i
should
replac
that
with
there
s
obvious
a
way
as
the
sequenc
menu
doe
thi
the
mark
unseen
menu
entri
in
the
messag
more
menu
is
still
want
that
function
as
well
msg
mark
unseen
i
m
not
sure
how
i
miss
the
need
to
fix
thi
in
app
default
for
mark
unseen
i
guess
that
ll
be
my
next
cv
fix
for
those
who
have
other
sequenc
defin
the
window
will
widen
to
display
the
other
sequenc
ani
chanc
of
have
that
lengthen
instead
i
like
all
my
exmh
stuff
in
nice
column
fit
the
display
better
that
is
i
use
the
detach
folder
list
one
column
the
main
exmh
window
take
up
full
screen
top
to
bottom
but
less
than
half
the
width
etc
i
thought
about
that
the
first
order
approxim
would
be
to
just
add
use
pack
side
top
instead
of
pack
side
left
howev
sinc
their
each
a
differ
width
it
would
look
funni
i
have
space
for
more
sequenc
in
the
unseen
window
as
long
as
they
remain
onc
nice
narrow
window
best
would
be
if
the
sequenc
could
be
order
by
some
prefer
then
one
which
didn
t
fit
would
just
fall
off
the
bottom
and
not
be
shown
i
d
also
prefer
it
if
that
window
had
no
unusu
background
colour
just
one
constant
colour
i
have
been
run
the
unseen
window
with
background
black
on
a
root
window
that
is
all
black
with
no
border
or
other
decor
but
made
sticki
the
appear
is
just
like
the
folder
with
unseen
messag
and
their
count
are
written
into
the
root
window
becaus
it
is
sticki
thi
small
display
follow
me
around
and
do
i
can
see
when
new
mail
need
process
the
background
color
in
thi
window
is
the
same
as
the
background
color
in
the
ftoc
i
also
find
that
i
tend
to
have
a
bunch
of
sequenc
that
onli
ever
occur
in
one
folder
some
i
had
forgotten
i
ever
creat
so
in
addit
to
the
sequenc
to
alway
show
and
sequenc
to
never
show
a
prefer
to
onli
show
sequenc
that
occur
in
more
than
one
folder
would
be
use
and
then
have
the
sequenc
that
occor
onli
in
the
folder
i
m
visit
appear
in
the
list
when
that
folder
is
current
thi
is
just
to
keep
the
list
size
somewhat
manag
while
remain
product
i
quit
often
use
a
sequenc
to
rememb
a
particular
messag
in
a
folder
the
name
is
use
onli
there
and
onli
for
one
messag
it
give
me
a
handl
on
the
messag
which
remain
as
the
folder
is
pack
sort
etc
hmmm
let
me
think
about
it
i
haven
t
updat
my
exmh
for
some
time
now
so
i
m
not
sure
if
thi
next
one
is
new
or
just
new
sinc
number
number
but
the
sequenc
menu
on
the
bar
with
new
flist
search
onli
contain
unseen
and
urgent
it
would
be
use
if
it
contain
all
of
the
sequenc
that
the
folder
happen
to
have
defin
a
new
sequenc
entri
would
also
be
use
to
mark
the
messag
with
a
sequenc
name
that
didn
t
previous
exist
which
can
be
done
now
use
search
and
the
pick
interfac
but
is
clumsi
that
way
the
onli
sequenc
that
are
defin
there
are
sequenc
which
are
defin
in
app
default
color
or
exmh
exmh
default

i
ve
been

about
how
to
dynam
gener
highlight
for
other

but
haven

figur
out
yet
