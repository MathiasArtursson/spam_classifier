you
have

there
are
a

of

that

and
that
much
of

may
not

some
recent
research
point
worth
mention
recent
high
resolut
studi
of
histor
co
number
concentr
and
temperatur
over
hundr
of
thousand
of

have
shown
a
modest
correl

the
two
in
a

of
case
co

increas
are
not

the
more

of

the
more
it
seem
that
co

are

but
are
not

caus
there
is
a

of
evid
that

i
don

anyon
realli
ha
an

answer
as
to
exactli
how
thi
work
yet
with
respect
to
absolut
co
number
concentr
it
is
also
import
to
point
out
that
our
best
data
to
date
suggest
that
they
follow
a
fairli
regular
cycl
with
a
period
of
about
number
number
year
at
previou
cycl
peak
the
concentr
were
similar
to
what
they
are
now
if
thi
cycl
ha
ani
valid
and
we
onli
have
good
data
for
number
number
complet
cyclic
period
but
which
look
surprisingli
regular
in
shape
and
time
then
we
should
be
almost
exactli
at
a
peak
right
now
as
it
happen
current
co
number
concentr
are
within
number
of
other
previou
cyclic

peak
for
which
we
have
good
data
in
other
word
we
may
be
ad
to
the
co

but
it
look
a
lot
like
we
would
be
build
a
molehil
on

of
a

in

at

there
