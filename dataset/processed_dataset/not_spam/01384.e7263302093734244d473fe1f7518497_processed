i
think
i
ve
work
on
sa
enough
to
understand
that
i
can
local
a
score
i
m
just
not
comfort
with
use
spamassassin
as
a
vehicl
for
drum
up
your
busi
at
the
expens
of
our
user
base
thi
is
exactli
what
i
think
spamassassin
ha
alway
been
conserv
about
ad
unproven
rbl
and
such
and
thi
should
be
the
same
i
think
it
would
make
more
sens
to
start
habea
with
a
less
aggress
score
one
which
will
not
give
spammer
a
quick
path
into
everyon
s
inbox
and
after
we
ve
seen
evid
that
the
system
work
then
we
can
increas
the
magnitud
of
the
score
i
say
start
it
with
a
zero
score
and
put
it
in
number
cv
rule
under
test
like
ani
other
unproven
rule
then
score
it
base
on
actual
result
not
promis
my
corpu
doe
not
yet
contain
a
singl
non
spam
or
spam
messag
with
a
habea
mark
base
on
that
it
doesn
t
impress
me
and
it
wouldn
t
impress
the
ga
either
rule
with
exactli
the
same
statist
are
be
drop
from
sa
right
now
and
i
don
t
see
whi
thi
should
be
ani
differ
