codeweav
ha
realli
hit
a
sweet
spot
with
their
recent
releas
crossov
offic
product
thi
is
quit
simpli
the
fulfil
of
the
promis
of
the
wine
project
use
thi
slick
littl
app
virtual
all
the
applic
in
the
microsoft
offic
suit
are
fulli
function
in

frankli
i
never
thought
i
d
see
the
day
when
run
window
app
in
linux
wa
excit
mayb
it
s
time
to
take
up
shuck
ice
cube
in
the
blast
land
let
s
break
thi
product
up
a
bit
if
purchas
as
a
bundl
both
crossov
offic
and
crossov
plugin
as
we
discuss
yesterday
share
an
instal
script
they
do
howev
requir
separ
instal
process
so
they
need
to
be
launch
individu
from
a
share
window
i
start
the
crossov
offic
instal
drop
my
offic
number
disc
in
the
cd
drive
and
fire
up
the
instal
it
look
and
perform
exactli
as
you
d
expect
to
see
it
in
window
i
wa
abl
to
custom
the
instal
as
i
alway
have
then
let
it
run
at
the
end
of
the
process
crossov
offic
fake
a
window
reboot
and
the
offic
suit
instal
is
complet
even
internet
explor
number
number
is
instal
there
s
an
option
in
the
crossov
offic
packag
to
instal
ie
number
number
but
to
my
chagrin
thi
wa
the
one
area
of
the
instal
that
fail
actual
the
instal
itself
may
have
succeed
i
wa
just
left
without
an
ie
browser
follow
the
upgrad
it
s
hard
to
tell
whether
that
wa
a
fault
in
crossov
offic
or
in
the
ie
program
itself
for
the
most
part
these
app
perform
in
linux
as
they
do
in
window
the
ie
instal
wa
a
bit
kludgi
with
some
font
problem
and
an
inabl
to
custom
the
toolbar
word
work
perfectli
allow
me
even
to
pull
togeth
legal
document
for
a
friend
s
busi
without
so
much
as
a
hiccup
even
print
work
well
with
the
instal
of
a
wine
postscript
printer
driver
let
me
reiter
someth
i
said
yesterday
i
ve
watch
the
wine
project
walk
then
crawl
then
walk
again
over
the
past
few
year
i
ve
alway
suspect
that
the
fit
and
start
were
not
for
lack
of
talent
with
the
financi
back
of
codeweav
it
appear
that
my
suspicion
were
well
found
wine
ha
through
crossov
offic
and
crossov
plugin
matur
to
a
level
of
useabl
that
should
easili
attract
linux
user
throughout
the
spectrum
of
experi
in
the
big
pictur
widespread
accept
of
these
product
could
remov
the
last
remain
roadblock
for
mani
current
window
user
to
make
the
leap
to
linux
the
loss
of
word
and
excel
they
simpli
don
t
need
to
fear
those
loss
ani
more
a
note
on
the
for
pay
structur
of
these
product
seem
in
order
as
you
well
know
i
m
an
open
sourc
guy
through
and
through
but
thi
is
clearli
a
case
in
which
the
free
effort
of
talent
and
dedic
develop
simpli
wasn
t
enough
to
close
the
gap
the
valu
of
these
product
easili
outweigh
their
minim
cost
and
if
it
keep
these
develop
move
forward
it
seem
to
be
the
perfect
pay
model
for
linux
recommend
it
send
us
a
gnometweak

part
x
today
we
re
look
into
the
mysteri
of
plug
and
play
support
in
your
linux
kernel
configur
there
s
realli
not
much
mysteri
to
it
thi
section
simpli
ask
the
question

with
your
current
machin
there
s
no
use
to
add
the
overhead
of
pnp
to
your
system
s
kernel
code
or
as
a
loadabl
modul
if
on
the
other
hand
you
ve
got

or
on
an
older
system
isa
slot
just
beg
to
be
fill
build
thi
support
into
