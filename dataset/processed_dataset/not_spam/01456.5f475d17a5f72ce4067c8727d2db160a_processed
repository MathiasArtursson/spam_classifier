i
think
we
should
even
add
new
ga
d
rule
to
number
number
x
and
or
remov
old
one
and
tag
a
new
number
number
onli
if
we
have
a
bunch
of
featur
worth
a
danger
big
updat
i
d
say
ye
you
should
expect
number
number
and
also
number
number
but
updat
to
number
number
now
i
would
think
ad
new
rule
to
or
remov
broken
rule
from
number
number
x
would
requir
some
discuss
first
but
new
ga
d
score
are
definit
worth
put
in
as
the
one
there
are
too
wild
i
think
my
mail
wasn
t
veri
clear
my
point
wa
that
we
should
continu
releas
new
rule
and
remov
broken
one
all
base
on
discuss
on
thi
list
of
cours
in
the
number
number
branch
instead
of
creat
a
new
number
number
branch
everytim
we
have
a
bunch
of
new
rule
a
new
branch
should
be
openend
onli
if
big
new
featur
are
introduc
eg
bay
or
the
interfac
ha
chang
spam
level
char
x
as
the
rule
are
under
fluent
develop
the
user
ha
to
updat
quit
regularli
but
current
he
couldn
t
be
shure
if
the
new
releas
will
break
anyth
in
hi
setup
like
f
go
away
so
if
we
say
the
branch
are
stabl
to
the
outsid
and
just
improv
under
the
surfac
but
you
have
to
watch
out
when
you
updat
to
a
new
minor
version
number
user
and
sysadmin
could
be
less
reluct
to
updat
all
just
imho
