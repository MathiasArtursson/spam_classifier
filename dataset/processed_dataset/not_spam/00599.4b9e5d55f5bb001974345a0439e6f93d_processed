ok
time
for
me
to
pipe
in
honestli
i
find
it
odd
that
the
spam
fight
group
aren
t
work
and
play
well
when
the
common
enemi
is
the
spammer
not
each
other
map
and
orb
had
a
battl
for
a
while
and
now
dcc
seem
to
have
issu
with
razor
honestli
work
on
your
own
stuff
and
let
s
fix
the
spam
problem
not
pull
out
ruler
in
a
spam
filter
i
m
much
much
more
concern
about
fals
posit
than
fals
neg
addit
sinc
spam
type
are
so
vari
i
use
all
avail
and
trustworthi
to
me
method
to
detect
it
i
tend
to
want
someth
that
ha
three
level
although
noth
like
thi
exist
yet
red
is
most
certainli
spam
verifi
by
high
rate
from
sever
sourc
and
noon
say
i
know
thi
is
not
spam
i
d
probabl
drop
thi
into
a
bit
bucket
or
archiv
it
for
humor
valu
i
expect
no
fals
posit
to
be
here
yellow
thi
may
be
spam
a
human
should
decid
and
report
green

is
probabl
not

isn
t
switch
not
is
mayb
isn
t
