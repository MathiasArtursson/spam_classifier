just
thought
i
d
pass
thi
on
my
favorit
radio
station
in
raleigh
is
go
off
the
internet
due
to
the
new
fee
and
restrict
associ
with
remain
onlin
thi
is
from
the
station
manag
and
describ
the
situat
forward
messag
date
tue
number
sep
number
number
number
number
number
from
ariel
subject
re
knc
stream
number
number
number
thi
messag
wa
sent
from
wknc
chat
it
doe
but
it
s
not
the
cost
that
is
caus
us
to
shut
it
down
the
cost
is
a
minimum
dollar
number
per
year
but
that
onli
account
for
number
peopl
stream
and
play
like
number
or
number
song
an
hour
but
we
could
mayb
manag
the
number
cent
per
person
per
number
song
the
problem
come
with
the
record
keep
they
mandat
with
webstream
start
and
end
time
for
everi
song
not
too
hard
artist
okay
titl
okay
compos
a
littl
harder
serial
number
wtf
i
think
there
are
a
few
more
thing
they
want
but
honestli
program
thi
info
in
for
everi
song
that
we
play
is
ridicul
thi
mean
we
d
also
have
to
get
all
the
dj
to
find
thi
info
and
write
it
down
ani
time
they
play
a
request
vinyl
or
cd
not
load
into
the
comput
it
s
ridicul
and
nearli
imposs
we
would
need
someon
to
sit
in
the
studio
number
number
write
down
all
thi
info
which
sometim
isn
t
avail
like
from
earlier
album
that
don
t
have
serial
number
and
barcod
then
still
if
onli
the
magic
number
peopl
webstream
our
signal
the
price
would
becom
quit
exponenti
sinc
we
play
on
averag
number
song
an
hour
we
d
be
pay
dollar
number
number
everyday
to
stream
to
those
number
peopl
so
realli
it
doe
have
to
do
with
the
internet
tax
but
it
is
a
few
reason
togeth
whi
we
can
t
do
it
after
their
kill
date
sent
use
phorum
softwar
version
number
