number
or
so
it
is
rumour
hereabout
niall
o
broin
thought
i
m
instal
warm
standbi
disk
on
a
number
of
box
these
disk
will
be
the
same
size
sometim
bigger
than
the
main
disk
the
idea
is
that
everi
night
i
ll
rsync
the
partit
on
the
main
disk
to
the
standbi
disk
so
that
in
the
case
of
disast
the
first
port
of
call
befor
the
tape
is
the
standbi
disk
we
did
consid
run
linux
md
raid
on
the
disk
but
raid
give
you
no
protect
against
slip
of
the
finger
so
in
the
event
of
finger
slip
we
can
mount
the
relev
partit
and
retriev
the
banjax
file
in
the
case
of
a
disk
crash
the
plan
is
that
we
ll
put
the
standbi
disk
in
place
of
the
main
disk
and
the
workstat
will
be
back
up
asap
then
we
can
deal
with
replac
the
disk
without
the
pressur
of
a
broken
box
on
our
back
howev
i
m
stump
as
to
how
to
instal
lilo
on
the
backup
disk
let
s
say
the
master
disk
is
dev
hda
and
the
backup
disk
is
dev
hdb
lilo
conf
current
look

there
are
a

but
they
re
not
german
as
you
can
see
is
on
dev
hda
number
and
boot
is
on
dev
hda
number
so
if
for
instanc
i
had
boot
from
a
cd
and
want
to
re
instal
lilo
on
thi
disk
i
d
do
someth
like
mount
dev
hda
number
mnt
mount
dev
hda
number
mnt
boot
lilo
r
mnt
which
is
ok
becaus
i
m
instal
lilo
on
dev
hda
and
i
want
it
to
boot
from
dev
hda
so
it
ll
plug
in
all
the
right
number
howev
in
the
case
of
the
standbi
disk
i
ll
have
to
do
someth
like
mount
dev
hdb
number
mnt
mount

hdb
number
mnt
boot
lilo
r
mnt
but
i
m
obvious
go
to
have
to
do
someth
differ
here
becaus
i
want
to
instal
onto
dev
hdb
in
such
a
way
that
the
disk
will
boot
when
it
becom
dev

i
think
that

is
analog
to
the
