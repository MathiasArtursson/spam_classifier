complet
failur
as
far
as

concern
utter
disappoint
pelley
there
ha
been
some
concern
over
the
year
about
civil
liberti
mr

yeah
pelley
in
fact
an
appeal
court
recent
wa
harsh
about
your
administr
decis
to
close
certain
deport
hear
they
said
quot
a
govern
oper
in
secreci
stand
in
opposit
to
the
constitut
where
do
you
draw
the
line
sir
mr
bush
i
draw
the
line
at
the
constitut
we
will
protect
america
but
we
will
do
so
on
within
the
guidelin
of
the
constitut
confin
of
the
constitut
spirit
of
the
constitut
pelley
is
there
anyth
that
the
justic
depart
ha
brought
to
you
as
an
idea
that
youv
thought
no
that
too
far
i
dont
wanna
go
mr
bush
nah
not
that
that
i
rememb
and
i
am
pleas
with
the
justic
depart
i
think
that
attorney
gener
do
a
fine
job
by
the
way
and
to
the
extent
that
our
court
are
will
to
make
sure
that
they
review
decis
we
make
i
think
that
fine
i
mean
that
good
it
healthi
it
part
of
america
pelley
franklin
roosevelt
said
that
america
should
stand
in
defens
of
four
freedom
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
religion
freedom
from
want
and
freedom
from
fear
do
we
have
that
today
mr
presid
freedom
from
fear
mr
bush
i
think
more
than
we
did
in
retrospect
the
fact
that
we
are
on
alert
the
fact
that
we
understand
the
new
circumst
make
us
more
free
from
fear
than
on
that
fate
day
of
septemb
the
number
th
weve
got
more
work
to
do
pelley
and
american
should
not
live
their
live
in
fear
mr
bush
i
dont
think
so
no
i
think
american
oughta
know
their
govern
do
everyth
possibl
to
help
and
obvious
if
we
get
inform
that
relat
directli
a
particular
attack
well
deal
with
it
and
if
we
get
nois
that
deal
with
a
gener
attack
well
alert
peopl
there
are
a
lot
of
good
folk
work
hard
to
disrupt
and
deni
and
run
down
lead
and
the
american
peopl
need
to
go
about
their
live
it
seem
like
they
are
